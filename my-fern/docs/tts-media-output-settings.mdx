  Deepgram provides support for generating audio output in various formats, each
  with specific encoding options.

Upon successful processing of a Deepgram text-to-speech request, you will receive an audio file containing the synthesized text-to-speech output.

<Info>
  If you don't provide any values for encoding, container or sample rate in your request Deepgram will provide the following defaults depending on which API / Protocol you use.

  **Streaming Defaults** encoding: `Linear16`container: `n/a` sample\_rate: `24000`

  **REST Defaults** encoding: `Linear16` container: `wav` sample\_rate: `24000`

## Audio Format Combinations

While Deepgram offers flexibility in choosing encoding options, **there are predefined combinations of audio formats with specific configurations** that you must adhere to. These combinations determine the encoding parameters, container format, sample rate, bitrate, and content-type header attached to the response.

<Info>
  Refer to the above Table for which formats are supported for REST and Streaming.

## Audio Format Outputs

Depending on which Encoding and Container you choose to use, you will receive the following audio output.

| Encoding   | Container | Content-Type            |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| `linear16` | `wav`     | `audio/wav`             |
| `linear16` | `none`    | `audio/l16;rate=24000`  |
| `mulaw`    | `wav`     | `audio/wav`             |
| `mulaw`    | `none`    | `audio/mulaw;rate=8000` |
| `alaw`     | `wav`     | `audio/wav`             |
| `alaw`     | `none`    | `audio/alaw;rate=8000`  |
| `mp3`      | `n/a`     | `audio/mpeg`            |
| `opus`     | `ogg`     | `audio/ogg;codecs=opus` |
| `flac`     | `n/a`     | `audio/flac`            |
| `aac`      | `n/a`     | `audio/aac`             |

## FAQ & Troubleshooting

### Why does Streaming Text to Speech only support a limited set of audio formats?

Currently we only support `linear16`, `mulaw` , and `alaw`for our [Streaming TTS Websocket](/reference/transform-text-to-speech-websocket). In the future we may offer additional support for other audio formats.

### Why do I hear clicks in my audio?

If you encounter a problem of hearing "clicks" in the audio, we recommend that you add `container=none` to the request.

These clicks can occur when integrating with telephony providers, i.e. services that handle real-time communication such as VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol). When using these services, you probably want to use raw audio without a container. If you don't specify `container=none`, the default container of `wav` will be requested, which will result in header information being misinterpreted by the service, leading to anomalies such as clicks or static sounds.

Be sure to ask Deepgram to provide raw audio by setting `container=none`; otherwise, you will likely hear static or clicking at the beginning of the audio playback as your speaker tries to interpret the accidentally-included container as actual audio.

<Warning>
  When using VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol), we recommend adding `container=none` to your request to prevent request header information being misinterpreted as audio, which can result in static or click sounds.
</Warning>

### Why do certain audio formats have a default container and some don't?

Many encodings require a certain container format as part of their specification (e.g., `MP3`, `FLAC`, `AAC`), so Deepgram can't provide container options for those.

Other encodings can be container-less (e.g., raw audio). This is why `wav` and `none` are options for those.

With raw audio you no longer have metadata to give you information like the sample rate or encoding.

### Why do certain audio formats have sample rate options and some don't?

Some formats specify their sample rates, so we cannot provide `sample_rate` options for them.

### Why do certain audio formats have bit rates options and some don't?

Uncompressed audio formats don't have configurable bit rates, so we cannot provide `bit_rate` options for them.
