The Deepgram Go SDK can be found at the [Go SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk) repository on GitHub, along with more detailed documentation about getting up and running with the SDK.

Since Deepgram's Go SDK is officially supported as of `v1`, Deepgram actively works to keep the SDK up-to-date with our newest features. As it is an open source project, we highly encourage contributions and feedback from the community.

<Info>
  The Go SDK v1 is now released as a GA with official Deepgram support. Give it a try!
