Deepgram's interconnected self-hosted optional components support advanced features that enhance the Deepgram Engine and API.

Optional components include:

* **[License Proxy Server](/docs/license-proxy)**: Serves as an intermediary between our hosted license server and your self-hosted deployment. We recommend installing this component to ensure constant uptime for request authorizations.

* **SIPREC**: For customers who would prefer to use Deepgram's real-time transcription on a traditional telephony stack rather than with websockets, Deepgram offers a native SIPREC integration solution.

* **[UniMRCP Plugin](/docs/deepgram-unimrcp-plugin)**: Offers speech recognition for cross-platform MRCP services.
