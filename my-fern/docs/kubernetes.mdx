## Should I use this for my self-hosted environment?

Kubernetes is a powerful ecosystem that can be customized to meet almost any business requirement. It is a great option for environments with extensive security, availability, and scaling requirements, such as production environments handling high levels of API traffic.

The power of Kubernetes is bundled with a greater level of complexity when compared with lighter platforms such as Docker or Podman. The following environment types usually only require a small, static number of Deepgram containers, which you may consider deploying with [Docker/Podman](/docs/dockerpodman) instead:

* Development environments
* Proof-of-concept implementations
* Production environment handling low levels of API traffic
