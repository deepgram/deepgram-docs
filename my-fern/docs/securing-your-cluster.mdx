# Secrets

Deepgram strongly recommends following best practices for configuring Kubernetes Secrets. Resources offered by Deepgram assist your secrets security posture as follows:

* The `deepgram-self-hosted` Helm chart includes options to configure RBAC rules for all resources.
* Deepgram documentation instructs users to deploy Deepgram services in a dedicated namespace in your cluster.
  * This prevents workloads in other namespaces from reading Secrets intended for Deepgram-related resources, and restricts Deepgram-related resources from reading Secrets deployed in other namespaces in your cluster.
* Deepgram documentation recommends using an external Secret store provider.
