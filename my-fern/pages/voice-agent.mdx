In this guide you’ll learn how to develop applications using [Deepgram’s Agent API](/).

1. Follow the steps in [Make Your First API Request](/docs/make-your-first-api-request) guide to obtain a Deepgram API key, and configure your environment if you are using a Deepgram SDK.
2. View our [API Specification](/) for more details on how to interact with this interface, view control messages available, and obtain examples for responses from Deepgram.
3. View other implementation examples for reference
  - [Voice Agent Demo](https://github.com/deepgram/voice-agent-demo)
  - [Conversational AI Demo](https://github.com/deepgram/conversational-ai-demo)
  - [Voice Agent with OpenAI Azure](https://github.com/deepgram/voice-agent-openai-azure)
  - [Voice Agent with Amazon Bedrock](https://github.com/deepgram/voice-agent-amazon-bedrock)
4. Open your terminal, navigate to the location on your drive where you want to create your project, and install the Deepgram SDK.
  <CodeBlocks>
  ```bash Python
  # EA  Beta Branch
  # https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-js-sdk/releases/tag/v3.9.0-beta.1
  # currently only available via unstable build
  
  npm install @deepgram/sdk@3.9.0-beta.1
  ```
  
  ```bash JavaScript
  # EA  Beta Branch
  # https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-js-sdk/releases/tag/v3.9.0-beta.1
  # currently only available via unstable build
  
  npm install @deepgram/sdk@3.9.0-beta.1
  ```
  </CodeBlocks>

5. Make the Request with the SDK
  <CodeBlocks>
  ```python Python
  from deepgram import Deepgram
  
  deepgram = Deepgram(api_key=os.getenv('DEEPGRAM_API_KEY'))
  
  response = deepgram.agent.send_message('Hello, how are you?')
  ```

  ```javascript Node.js
  const deepgram = require('@deepgram/sdk');    
  
  const agent = new deepgram.Agent({
    apiKey: process.env.DEEPGRAM_API_KEY,
    agentId: process.env.DEEPGRAM_AGENT_ID,
  });
  
  const response = await agent.sendMessage('Hello, how are you?');
  console.log(response);
  ```
  </CodeBlocks>
