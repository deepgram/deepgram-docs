A record of errors and reasons you will receive them when using the Deepgram API.

## General API Errors

Errors that could be returned on any endpoint.

### 400 Invalid JSON submitted

When making a `POST` request with JSON data, you must include all required fields. If required fields are missing or the submitted JSON is invalid, a `400 Bad Request` will be returned. The response will be similar to the below, depending on the endpoint and how the JSON is malformed.

```json JSON
{
  "category": "INVALID_JSON",
  "message": "Invalid JSON submitted.",
  "details": "Json deserialize error: missing field `xxx` at line 7 column 1",
  "request_id": "uuid"
}
---
{
  "err_code": "Bad Request",
  "err_msg": "Content-type was application/json, but we could not process the JSON payload.",
  "request_id": "uuid"
}
```

### 400 Unknown request body format

If you receive the following error:

```json JSON
{
  "err_code": "Bad Request",
  "err_msg": "Bad Request: failed to process audio: corrupt or unsupported data",
  "request_id": "uuid"
}
```

Often, this is caused by sending Deepgram a URL to transcribe, but failing to set a `Content-Type: application/json` header. When sending Deepgram a JSON payload containing a URL, the `Content-Type: application/json` must be set in the request.

If you are sending an audio file and not a URL, you may be sending corrupted audio. You can use tools such as `ffprobe` or Audacity to confirm that your audio file is valid.

### 401 Incorrect API key

Providing an invalid API key will return `401 Unauthorized` with the following error:

```json JSON
{
  "err_code": "INVALID_AUTH",
  "err_msg": "Invalid credentials.",
  "request_id": "uuid"
}
```

### 403 Insufficient Permissions

Making a request for a model that you do not have access to will return `403 Forbidden` with this error.

```json JSON
{
  "err_code": "INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS",
  "err_msg": "Project does not have access to the requested model.",
  "request_id": "uuid"
}
```

### 404 UUID Parsing Failed

Providing an invalid Project ID will fail parsing and return `404 Not Found` with this response:

```txt Text
UUID parsing failed: invalid character: expected an optional prefix of `urn:uuid:` followed by [0-9a-zA-Z], found `p` at 1
```

### 404 Project not found
When a project isn't found it will result in `404 Not Found`. It may be because;

- the Project ID is incorrect
- the Project ID is for a project that has been deleted
- the Project ID is not associated with the API key used to make the request

```json JSON
{
  "err_code": "PROJECT_NOT_FOUND",
  "err_msg": "Project not found."
}
```

## Speech to Text errors

### 402 Insufficient Credits

When attempting to transcribe a file, you may not have sufficient funds to complete the request. This will result in a `402 Payment Required` error with this error.

```json
{
  "err_code": "ASR_PAYMENT_REQUIRED",
  "err_msg": "Project does not have enough credits for an ASR request and does not have an overage agreement.",
  "request_id": "uuid"
}
```

### 429 Rate Limit Exceeded

When requests are made in excess of Deepgram's [rate limits](/), a `429 Too Many Requests` is returned with the following error. An [exponential-backoff retry strategy](/) is recommended to accommodate rate-limiting when submitting a large volume of concurrent requests.


```json JSON
{
  "err_code": "TOO_MANY_REQUESTS",
  "err_msg": "Too many requests. Please try again later",
  "request_id": "uuid"
}
```

### Handling HTTP Errors

Some error codes, such as `400: Bad Request` errors, can be prevented in your production code by careful testing and development.

**Production**

Below is a list of HTTP error codes that your production code should handle gracefully:

- **408 Request Timeout**: The server timed out waiting for the request.
- **413 Request Entity Too Large**: The request is larger than the server is willing or able to process.
- **429 Too Many Requests**: The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time.

### Development

The following errors are more likely to be encountered in a development environment:

- **400 Bad Request**: The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.
- **401 Unauthorized**: The API key is invalid or unauthorized.
- **402 Payment Required**: The project has insufficient funds to complete the request.
- **404 Not Found**: The specified entity ID could not be found.
