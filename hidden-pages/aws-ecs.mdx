Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service that helps you deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. This guide discusses running Deepgram products in a self-hosted environment using AWS ECS.

## Should I use this for my self-hosted environment?

Amazon Elastic Container Service is a simple, fast approach for deploying containers. It has more auto-scaling flexibility than [basic EC2 instances using Docker or Podman](/dockerpodman), and less operational complexity than a [Kubernetes cluster](/kubernetes). The tradeoff is that as a managed cloud service, it  typically has higher cloud costs than the other two approaches, and also can lead to vendor lock-in with AWS.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have completed the requirements in the [Self-Hosted Introduction](/docs/self-hosted-introduction#prerequisites).

## Create an AWS ECS Cluster

To begin your self-hosted installation with AWS as your cloud service provider, you need to create an Amazon EC2 instance.

1. Navigate to the ECS Dashboard and confirm that the proper AWS Region is configured, then choose **Create cluster** to open the wizard.

2. For the **Cluster name** wizard step, type `deepgram-self-hosted`, or another appropriate description of this cluster.

3. For the **Infrastructure** wizard step, select `AWS Fargate (serverless)` in order to support auto-scaling.

4. For the **Monitoring** wizard step, enable `Use Container insights`.
   1. Submitting diagnostic information, such as the information provided by AWS CloudWatch, is required when filing a self-hosted deployment ticket with Deepgram Support.

5. Verify the cluster information, and click `Create`.

## Create an ECS Task Definition

Your ECS cluster needs to know what containers to run, and their configuration and relationships with each-other. This is provided in the task definition.

## Configure your ECS Cluster

Once your cluster is created, select it from the menu to begin configuration.
