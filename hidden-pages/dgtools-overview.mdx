Deepgram offers custom model training as part of our [Enterprise offering](https://deepgram.com/enterprise). Typically, a customer will provide the needed data to Deepgram, and our team can handle all aspects of turning that data into a custom model for your use case.

There may be situations where you want to train your own custom models in your self-hosted environment. DGTools offers a path forward. Users of DGTools can take a general domain model and train it with production-representative data, or trainable data, to produce a targeted domain model.

The quality of your trainable data matters. Errors in transcription will lead to sub-optimal outcomes.

<Warning title="Limited Model Support">
DGTools is only available for Base and Enhanced Deepgram models. If you are interested in fine-tuning Nova, Nova-2, Aura, or other models, please contact [support](https://deepgram.com/contact-us/) .
</Warning>

## Use Cases

- Reducing word error rate (WER) by teaching an uncommon word to a general domain model, producing a targeted domain model.
- Reducing WER by improving targeted domain model confidence with additional trainable data.

## Deploying DGTools

### Prerequisites

#### Prepare Your Linux Environment

This guide is written assuming you are running Ubuntu and the environment has been prepared to run Deepgram self-hosted. If you are unfamiliar with the self-hosted cloud environment requirements, please review the [Self-Hosted Introduction](/docs/introduction-1) before proceeding with this guide.

<Warning>
Running DGTools and the Deepgram API/Engine at the same time on a single machine is not supported. They will compete for the same GPU resources and likely result in a CUDA Out-Of-Memory (OOM) error.
</Warning>
#### Container Image Setup

##### Container Image Repository Access

DGTools is provided as a Docker container image, hosted in [Quay](https://quay.io/)  at `quay.io/deepgram/self-hosted-dgtools`. You will need to be logged into Quay; see the [Self Service Licensing & Credentials](/docs/self-hosted-self-service-tutorial) guide for instructions.

##### Non-Root User

DGTools must be run as a non-root user. For instructions with Docker or Podman, see [step 2 of the "Install Container Runtime" section](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/drivers-and-containerization-platforms#install-container-runtime) in the Drivers and Container Orchestration Tools guide. For Kubernetes, you can specify a non-root user in the [pod security context](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/).

### Installing

#### Create the `dgtools` directory for the license file and training data

Create the `dgtools` directory and its `dgdatasets` subdirectory in your home directory `$HOME`. This directory will serve as the installation location of the DGTools license file as well as any user-provided data sets that will be used for model training.

```shell
mkdir -p $HOME/dgtools/dgdatasets
```

Create the `DGTOOLS_RESOURCE_DIR` environment variable, which points to the new `dgtools` directory. This statement will also add the `DGTOOLS_RESOURCE_DIR` environment variable to your `.bashrc` file.

```shell
export DGTOOLS_RESOURCE_DIR=$HOME/dgtools; \
echo "export DGTOOLS_RESOURCE_DIR=\$HOME/dgtools" >> $HOME/.bashrc
```

You should make this directory findable within your path by adding `DGTOOLS_RESOURCE_DIR` to your path and adding it to your `.bashrc` file.

```shell
export PATH=$DGTOOLS_RESOURCE_DIR:$PATH; \
echo "export PATH=\$DGTOOLS_RESOURCE_DIR:\$PATH" >> $HOME/.bashrc
```

#### Create the `dgtools` script

Use the following command to create the `dgtools` script in the `dgtools` directory:

```shell
cat > $DGTOOLS_RESOURCE_DIR/dgtools <<'EOF'
set -e
DGTOOLS_IMAGE=${DGTOOLS_IMAGE:-"quay.io/deepgram/self-hosted-dgtools"}
docker pull $DGTOOLS_IMAGE
docker run \
-t \
-i \
--gpus all \
--volume $DGTOOLS_RESOURCE_DIR:/dgtraining \
--volume $HOME:$HOME \
--user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
--rm $DGTOOLS_IMAGE \
"$(pwd)" "$@"
EOF
```

Make the script executable:

```shell
chmod +x $DGTOOLS_RESOURCE_DIR/dgtools
```

#### Create the `dgtools.toml` license file

Use the following command to create the `dgtools.toml` license file in the `dgtools` directory:

```shell
echo -e "[license]\n\nkey = \"REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY\"\nserver_url = \"https://license.deepgram.com\"" > $DGTOOLS_RESOURCE_DIR/dgtools.toml
```

Copy any data sets to be used for model training into the new `dgtools/dgdatasets` subdirectory:

```shell
cp [DATASET_DIRECTORY] $DGTOOLS_RESOURCE_DIR/dgdatasets/.
```

### Testing the Installation

Download the Docker container image for DGTools and test the installation:

```shell
dgtools version
```

The output should look similar to:

```shell Text
2.1.4: Pulling from deepgram/self-hosted-dgtools
Digest: sha256:99f87647a09aad82d2b7ad853af14e9561da1eb1529e2c6c39fd775f078d0c1f
Status: Image is up to date for deepgram/self-hosted-dgtools:2.1.4
quay.io/deepgram/self-hosted-dgtools:2.1.4

```

## Using DGTools

### DGTools `autotrain` subcommand

The primary subcommand for `dgtools` is `dgtools autotrain`. It allows a user to custom-train an initial model provided by Deepgram. Additionally, users can rename models and “top-off” a model with additional training data.

#### Models

DGTools supports customizing Deepgram's Base and Enhanced models.

#### Training Data

`dgtools/dgdatasets` is where DGTools will search for training data. You can copy new data sets into subdirectories within `dgtools/dgdatasets`, and DGTools will automatically find them the next time it’s run. Data sets must contain audio files and associated labeled audio transcript text files. A given audio file and its associated labeled audio transcript must share the same file name with different file extensions. Data sets must be self-contained within their own subdirectory (for example, `$DGTOOLS_RESOURCE_DIR/dgdatasets/example_data_set`).

#### Supported Languages

DGTools supports training models for a variety of languages in the open beta. The default language is `en` and the `dgdatasets` for English can exist as a subdirectory of `$DGTOOLS_RESOURCE_DIR`.

Additionally, DGTools can automatically detect the language type for a given model and search `$DGTOOLS_RESOURCE_DIR` for a matching subdirectory. Subdirectories for a specific language should match the BCP-47 language tag and contain a subdirectory named `dgdatsets`. For example, a Spanish dataset could be placed at `$DGTOOLS_RESOURCE_DIR/es/dgdatasets/example_data_set`.

#### Terminal sessions and `tmux`

We recommend running DGTools inside a `tmux` session to ensure that it is not interrupted during training.

You can list the current tmux sessions with the `tmux ls` command.

You can reattach to a tmux session with the `tmux attach -t SESSION_ID` command, where SESSION_ID matches your session ID from the current sessions list.

#### Using `autotrain` from scratch

To use DGTools to train an initial model, provide the path location of that model file to the `dgtools autotrain` subcommand. DGTools `autotrain` takes the path to the initial model to train as its only required parameter. If the model supports training, DGTools will train the model with the data sets from the `dgdatasets` directory and produce a `<model_name>.last.dg` file (for example, `general.last.dg`).

```shell
dgtools autotrain ./general.dg
```

In the output for the command, there is a a sample countdown which indicates how many samples are remaining in the training process. If a model does not support training, the command will return an error indicating that the model is not trainable. Please [contact Deepgram support](https://deepgram.com/contact-us/) for assistance if your model does not support training.

#### Topping-off a model with `autotrain --top-off`

If you are just adding additional training data to `dgdatsets/` and want to re-run `autotrain`, you can "top-off" the model using the `--top-off` flag to skip adding new vocabulary words and speed up the operation.

```shell
dgtools autotrain ./<model_name>.last.dg --top-off
```

#### Revisiting `dgdatasets/` with `--revisit-count N`

If you want to adjust the amount of times a given sample within `dgdatasets` is re-visited during `autotrain`, you can set the `--revisit-count N`, where N is the number of times a sample should be revisited. By default, `dgtools autotrain` revisits samples 20 times, whereas `dgtools autotrain --top-off` revisits samples 10 times.

```shell
dgtools autotrain ./general.last.dg --top-off --revisit-count 100
```

<Warning>
The default `--revisit-count` values for autotrain and topping-off were chosen to find a balance with training and the risk of “over-fitting” a model.

A model is considered to be “over-fit” when training starts to negatively impact its validation accuracy. Validation accuracy is a useful measure for determining when a model’s training is “complete” and is used by DGTools to create model checkpoints.
</Warning>

#### Continuous checkpointing

DGTools creates “checkpoint” models as it trains. DGTools does this by tracking the validation accuracy of the intermediate models it produces while training, and then preserving the best two copies as a `<model_name>.best.REMAINING_SAMPLE_COUNT.VALIDATION_ACCURACY.dg` file (for example, `general.best.1000.842.dg`). `REMAINING_SAMPLE_COUNT` is represented as an integer and can be intepreted as the number of samples remaining in the training process. `VALIDATION_ACCURACY` is represented as an integer and can be interpreted as a percentage, e.g. `842` -> `84.2%`.

DGTools also preserves the last two checkpoint models in addition to the two best checkpoint models. A model is only saved as a checkpoint model if it is neither of the best models.

#### Marking `dgdatasets/` data samples for inclusion in training or validation

In a given data set subdirectory within `dgdatasets`, two different files may exist:

- `keep_train.lst` may contain a source identifier (for example, a filename without the path or file extension) of files to attempt to include in the training list.
- `keep_validate.lst` may contain a source identifier (for example, a filename without the path or file extension) of files to attempt to include in the validation list.

Comments prefixed with `#` in either file will be ignored.

In the event of conflict where a source identifier is in either the training or validation lists for previous model training iterations, a warning will be printed to the screen and the new inclusion designation will be ignored.

#### Specifying data set subdirectories with `--dataset-locations`

The `--dataset-locations` argument can be used to specify a data set subdirectory or to provide a file containing a list of data set subdirectories. For example, if you know that within your `dgdatasets` directory you have subdirectories `A`, `B`, and `C` , you can tell DGTools to use only the `A` subdirectory with the following command:

```shell
dgtools autotrain example-model.dg --dataset-locations /dgtraining:A
```

If your data sets are organized into subdirectories by language code (like `en`), then reference the language code as part of the `--dataset-locations` path:

```shell
dgtools autotrain example-model.dg --dataset-locations /dgtraining/en:A
```

Alternatively, you could create a file named `datasets.lst` in your `$DGTOOLS_RESOURCE_DIR` (mounted within the Docker container as `/dgtraining`) and reference multiple data set subdirectories in that file. For example, if you wanted to use only the `A` and `C` data sets, you could add the following to `datasets.lst`:

```bash
# Include only A and C
/dgtraining:A
/dgtraining:C
```

and then pass that file to DGTools with the following command:

```shell
dgtools autotrain example-model.dg --dataset-locations /dgtraining/datasets.lst
```

### DGTools `makedeployable` subcommand

#### Providing `makedeployable` an output model name and tags

To output a model with a specific filename, use the flag `--name` and `--tags` to provide the name and any tags for the model’s metadata information. You can specify an arbitrary number of _string_ tags for the model via the `--tags` flag. If you do not use these flags, the default name will be derived from the model's metadata, as opposed to updating the new model's metadata with the name you supplied.

The `.last` model file should generally be used as the deployable file, but as a best practice we recommend evaluating either of the `.best` model files for deployment in addition to the `.last` model file.

```shell
$ dgtools makedeployable general.last.dg --name deployed_model --tags 1
Initializing the environment...
Complete.
Created deployed_model_en__1_deployable.dg.

$ ls
initial.dg general.last.dg deployed_model_en__1_deployable.dg
```

### Other DGTools subcommands

In addition to `autotrain`, these subcommands are useful for determining how to use DGTools, listing the supported training languages, retrieving and printing a model file’s metadata information, and printing the DGTools version information.

#### `help`

The `help` subcommand can be used to print out the built-in help information for DGTools:

```shell
$ dgtools help
Usage:
dgtools [SUBCOMMAND] [OPTIONS]
Valid subcommands are: autotrain, makedeployable, modelinfo, listlang, help, version. For help on individual subcommands, type the '--help' option after the subcommand.
See https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/dgtools for more information.
```

#### `listlang`

The `listlang` subcommand can be used to report the supported training languages:

```shell
$ dgtools listlang
Currently supported languages: en, es, nl, ko.
```

#### `modelinfo`

The `modelinfo` subcommand can be used to retrieve and print a given model’s metadata information, including whether or not the model is trainable and whether or not the model is deployable:

```shell
$ dgtools modelinfo ./deployed_model_en__1_deployable.dg
Model is trainable and deployable.
Name: deployed_model
UUID: a965179c-a8c3-457d-bc67-32b66f579656
Version: 2021-08-18
Tags: topped-off, example
Languages: en
```

#### `version`

The `version` subcommand can be used to print the current DGTools version information:

```shell
$ dgtools version
Copyright © 2022 Deepgram, Inc.
DGTools v2.1.1
```

You can also use the following docker command to output the DGTools container image information:

```shell
docker image inspect quay.iodeepgram/self-hosted-dgtools:<YOUR_TAG>
```
