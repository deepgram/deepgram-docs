Deepgram is excited to announce expanding our newest, most powerful ASR model tier, Enhanced, to include Spanish to bring you the highest accuracy for Spanish language support.

You can start using the General Enhanced Spanish Model in Console now by specifying model as ‘general’, tier as ‘enhanced’ and language as ‘es’.

For example, to call the General Enhanced Spanish Model, the URL query might look like

[*https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=general&tier=enhanced&language=es&punctuate=true*](https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=general&tier=enhanced&punctuate=true)

To learn more about the various parameters you can use to customize your transcriptions with Deepgram, check out the list of Deepgram’s[ features in our documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/documentation/features/). 

Before using the new Model in production, we recommend testing it alongside your typical feature adds, like keywords. Model updates may change transcription outputs.

Deepgram support is always available to walk customers through updates, as well as resolve any issues that arise when upgrading.
