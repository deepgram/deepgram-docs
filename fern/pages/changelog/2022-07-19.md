Deepgram is excited to announce expanding our newest, most powerful ASR model tier, Enhanced, to include Meeting use-case model to bring you the highest accuracy. Meeting model is optimized for conference room settings, which include multiple speakers with a single microphone.

You can start using the Meeting Enhanced Model in Console now by specifying model as ‘meeting’ and tier as ‘enhanced’. It is currently available for English.

For example, to call the Meeting English Enhanced Model, the URL query might look like

`*https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=meeting&tier=enhanced&punctuate=true*`

Before using the new Model in production, we recommend testing it alongside your typical feature adds, like keywords. Model updates may change transcription outputs.

Deepgram support is always available to walk customers through updates, as well as resolve any issues that arise when upgrading.
