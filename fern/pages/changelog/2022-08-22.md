paragraphs=true&punctuate=true

(*required — When* `paragraphs=true`, punctuation, diarization, and/or multichannel must be enabled)

Our new paragraphs feature breaks audio transcripts into nicely-formatted paragraphs and sentences for easier reading and parsing. The feature can be influenced by the addition of diarization or multichannel functionality to create breaks based on speaker or channel changes.

The feature can be useful for performing analytics on finer segments of a conversation, say for sentiment analysis, or for presenting a transcript in a more readable format.

To learn more about the feature, check out the feature guide in our [Documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/documentation/features/paragraphs/).
