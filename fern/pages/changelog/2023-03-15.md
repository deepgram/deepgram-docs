Deepgram is excited to announce a new version of the Endpointing feature. Endpointing is designed to get customers the fastest and most accurate transcripts. It can also help determine when someone has finished talking. Users can specify the amount of silence they want to wait for when someone finishes talking before Deepgram finalizes the transcript and returns it with the flag `speech_final`.

The Endpointing feature utilizes a powerful Voice Activity Detection algorithm to determine when someone has stopped speaking. Once speech has finished, Deepgram is able to quickly finalize a transcription of the speech and return it, along with a `speech_final` flag marking that an Endpoint was detected.

This algorithm can be configured through our Endpointing feature. To find out more, head to our [Endpointing documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/endpointing).
