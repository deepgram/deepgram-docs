language=tr
`version` =`2021-04-19.0`

We have done additional training to improve the accuracy and expand the vocabulary of our Turkish language support.

To use the latest Turkish support, pass the `language=tr` as an API parameter in your request. If you do not wish to use the latest version, be sure to specify the desired version as `version={desired_version}`.

Previous versions include:

- `2021-02-02.0`
- `2021-01-06.0`

Note that Turkish support is only available with Deepgram’s General Model (`model=general`).

Deepgram support, [**support@deepgram.com**](mailto:support@deepgram.com), is always available to help walk customers through new feature purpose and configuration, as well as resolve any issues that arise when upgrading.
