We're thrilled to announce the GA release of our entity detection feature for Deepgram Hosted customers. 

`detect_entities=true`

By including the new parameter in your pre-recorded speech-to-text requests (STT), you can identify and extract over 50 unique entity types. This release brings up to a 74% absolute improvement in detecting email addresses, names, locations, phone numbers, social security numbers, and more.



- See our [Entity Detection documentation ](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/detect-entities )and [supported entity types](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/supported-entity-types for information.) to learn more about using Entity Detection.
- For Self-Hosted customers, please reach out to your Deepgram contact if you'd like to use the new feature in beta.
