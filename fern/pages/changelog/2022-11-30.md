We’ve released a new open-source project designed to make it easier to get started with our live streaming transcription API: the [**streaming test suite.**](https://github.com/deepgram/streaming-test-suite)

The streaming test suite is designed to ensure you can stream basic audio to Deepgram before you begin building custom integrations. It also provides some sample Python code that may be helpful when creating your own integration.

After you successfully run the streaming test suite, you’ll be ready to integrate Deepgram with more complex audio sources. Happy building!
