### This Release Contains The Following Changes

- Adds new [streaming websocket TTS](https://deepgram.com/changelog/websocket-text-to-speech-api)!
  - This is a software feature, so no new TTS models are required.
  - To enable, add the feature flag `speak_streaming = true` in the `[features]` section of your `api.toml` file.
  - See the [help center guide](https://deepgram.gitbook.io/help-center/self-hosted/how-can-i-enable-streaming-text-to-speech-in-my-self-hosted-deployment) for further details.


- Improves beta streaming entity formatting.
- Reminder: The Deepgram image repositories have been updated to reflect our "self-hosted" naming. Images should now be pulled from the `self-hosted-*` Quay repositories. For the next ten months, both `onprem-*` and `self-hosted-*` image repositories will receive identical image updates monthly, and we will announce image tags in the `self-hosted` repositories. Subsequently, we will only publish new images to `self-hosted-*` repos, deprecating `onprem-*` repository variants.
- Keeps our software up-to-date.
