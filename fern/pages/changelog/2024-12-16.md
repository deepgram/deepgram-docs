### What's New

The profanity filtering system (`profanity_filter=true`) now includes:

- An expanded database of profane words and phrases
- Real-time filtering support for streaming audio
- Standardized asterisk replacement for filtered content

Note: Profanity Filtering is available for English-only.

### Key Changes

Previously, our system would replace detected profanity with similar-sounding words. With this update, all identified profane content is now consistently replaced with asterisks, providing clearer and more predictable output.

### Documentation & Support

- See our [Profanity Filter documentation ](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/detect-entities )to learn more.
- For Self-Hosted customers, please reach out to your Deepgram contact if you'd like to use the updated feature.
