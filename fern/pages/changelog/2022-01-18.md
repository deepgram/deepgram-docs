Deepgram is proud to announce significant updates to three of our base models — General (en-US), Phonecall (en-US), and Meeting (en-US).

These improvements greatly improve accuracy and expand model vocabulary.

If you do not wish to use** the latest version that was deployed as the default on January 18, 2022,** you may pin to a previous version by specifying the desired version as `version={desired_version}`. If no `version` is specified, we will use our latest model by default. See below for previous versions.
