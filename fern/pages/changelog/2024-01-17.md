`model = nova-2`

Deepgram has done additional training to our Nova-2 General Model for English to improve accuracy for pre-recorded transcription, specifically addressing an issue with missing words / phrases.  We intend to roll out similar updates for streaming transcription and across other Nova-2 tier models over the next two weeks.

There should be no code changes required on your end - all requests with model=nova-2 will automatically get the latest version with the fix applied.

For On-Premises customers, please reach out to your Deepgram contact if you'd like to update your models.
