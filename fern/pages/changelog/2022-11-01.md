We’ve made a change in our Diarizer to support all audio files, including very long audio files.

With the recent change, requests for very long audio files for the new diarizer (files longer than 3 hours) will no longer return 400 error code and will provide the result as expected.

You can access the new diarizer using the below URL:

`https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?diarize=true`

To learn more about the improved Diarizer, please see the [Diarizer](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/diarization) page in our documentation.

Our customer [support](mailto:support@deepgram.com) team is always available to work with you on any issues you may see with our latest version of the diarizer.
