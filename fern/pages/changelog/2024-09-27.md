### This Release Contains The Following Changes

- Improves efficiency of streaming diarization.
- Adds multichannel support for [Finalize](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/finalize) message.
- Adds broader support in Engine container for model auto-loading during runtime. 
  - Filesystems that don't support `inotify`, such as `nfs`/`csi` PersistentVolumes in Kubernetes, can now load and unload models during runtime without requiring a Pod restart.


- Enables the keyword-boosting feature for streaming by default.
- Improves opt-in beta entity recognition and entity formatting.
- Reminder: The Deepgram image repositories have been updated to reflect our "self-hosted" naming. Images should now be pulled from the `self-hosted-*` Quay repositories. For the next eleven months, both `onprem-*` and `self-hosted-*` image repositories will receive identical image updates monthly, and we will announce image tags in the `self-hosted` repositories. Subsequently, we will only publish new images to `self-hosted-*` repos, deprecating `onprem-*` repository variants.
- Keeps our software up-to-date.
