`model=nova-2-atc`

We're excited to announce that we have released a use case model for transcribing English **air traffic control **audio in our next-gen speech-to-text model, Nova-2.

With full pre-recorded and streaming capabilities, it's optimized for noisy and jargon heavy air traffic control conversations.

See our [documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/models-languages-overview) for information.

For Self-Hosted customers, please reach out to your Deepgram contact if you'd like to use the new model.
