### This Release Contains The Following Changes

- Improved support for container health checks/probes. There are now native endpoints available for all Deepgram containers to help you more easily manage container lifecycles and system maintenance. These probes can be configured with Kubernetes, or any other container orchestration technology that supports health probes. 
  - For help with using these endpoints, please contact your Deepgram Account Representative for updated configuration files. Further documentation will also be published describing available health probe endpoints, and will be linked to this changelog.


- Stability improvements, security patches, and bug fixes.üêõ
