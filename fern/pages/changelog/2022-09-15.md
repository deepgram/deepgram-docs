We are excited to announce our latest Speech Understanding feature – Summarization (*summarize=true*). Deepgram’s speech recognition API, with Summarization, can auto-generate meaningful summaries from the audio data.

Summarization API endpoint can be called using (*summarize=true*) and will return *summaries* block in the response body of the output. Each segment of the summary will have summarized text, start_word, and end_word.

Examples of use cases for Summarization include:

- Automatically generate call notes and meeting summaries to reduce manual effort.
- Navigate through a large number of calls and analyze important conversations through generated summaries.
- Help listeners identify interesting conversations through auto-generated meaningful podcast previews.

The URL query might look like this to call the Summarization API.
