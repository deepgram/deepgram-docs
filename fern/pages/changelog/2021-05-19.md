*new* version = `2021-05-19.0`

*previous* version = `2021-02-10.0`

We have done additional training to improve the accuracy and expand the vocabulary of our Spanish language support.

To use the latest Spanish support, pass the `language=es` as an API parameter in your request. If you do not wish to use the latest version, be sure to specify the desired version as `version={desired_version}`.

Previous versions include:

- `2021-02-10.0`
- `2020-11-24.0`

Note that Spanish support is only available with Deepgram’s General Model (`model=general`).
