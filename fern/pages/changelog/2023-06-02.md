Customers can now keep Deepgram streaming connections open during periods where no audio data is being sent. Previously, if no audio was being sent over the websocket, connections would close after a short window of time. We’ve introduced a new KeepAlive WebSocket message that clients can use to indicate to Deepgram that the WebSocket should be kept open even though no data is being sent through.
