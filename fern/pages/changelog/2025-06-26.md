**Reminder**: The Deepgram image repositories have been updated to reflect our "self-hosted" naming. Images should now be pulled from the `self-hosted-*` Quay repositories. For the next three months, both `onprem-*` and `self-hosted-*` image repositories will receive identical image updates monthly, and we will announce image tags in the `self-hosted` repositories. Subsequently, we will only publish new images to `self-hosted-*` repos, deprecating `onprem-*` repository variants.
