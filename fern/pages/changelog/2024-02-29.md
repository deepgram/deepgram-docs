### This Release Contains The Following Changes

- ‚ùóTo support our new token-based features, the License Proxy container (and Billing container, if using) must be updated either alongside or in advance of the Engine and API containers. Deepgram recommends a blue-green deployment of the License Proxy container if deploying concurrently. You will experience a service outage if you attempt to run the new Engine and API containers before the License Proxy container is updated. Please see [the linked PDF](https://static.deepgram.com/examples/Deepgram-February-2024-onprem-release-240228.pdf) for deployment recommendations.
- Major feature release: Support for all [speech intelligence features](https://deepgram.com/product/audio-intelligence), including summarization, sentiment analysis, intent recognition, and topic detection. These features are available for both [audio](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/stt-intelligence-feature-overview) and [text](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/text-intelligence-feature-overview).
- The License Proxy was updated to begin normal operations without requiring an explicit check-in from the API or Engine.¬†This update allows for additional License Proxy containers to be deployed as backups to the primary container. In addition, the memory footprint of the license proxy was significantly reduced when operating in cached-trust mode.
- [UtteranceEnd](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/utterance-end) now includes fields for the channel where the utterance ended, as well as the timestamp of the last word spoken.
- A new [SpeechStarted](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/speech-started) event pairs well with UtteranceEnd to detect when a person has started speaking during a stream.
- Fixed a bug for streaming where keywords were occasionally resulting in missing words in final transcripts.
- Stability improvements, security patches, and bug fixes.üêõ
