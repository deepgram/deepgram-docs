`model=nova-2&language=multi`

We're excited to announce that we have released our** multilingual code-switching support (Spanish and English)** in our next-gen speech-to-text model, Nova-2.

With full pre-recorded and streaming capabilities, and word-level language classification, it's optimized for all your complex code-switching use cases in an increasingly multilingual world.

See our [multilingual code-switching documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/multilingual-code-switching) for information.

For Self-Hosted customers, please reach out to your Deepgram contact if you'd like to use the new feature.
