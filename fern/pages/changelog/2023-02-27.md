New versions of our English (en-US) General model’s Base and Enhanced tiers have greatly improved accuracy and throughput. We are incredibly excited to release these enhancements to our customers. We are making the new tiers available for testing over the next two weeks so you can compare them to your current results. If you are interested in testing the new tiers please reach out to Deepgram support to enable access. We will be deploying the new tiers as defaults on March 14th, 2023.

If you do not wish to use the new versions that will be deployed as the default on March 14, 2023, you may pin to previous versions by specifying the desired version as version={desired_version}. If no version is specified, we will use our latest version by default. 

Most recent previous versions of these tiers:

Deepgram support is always available to walk customers through updates, as well as resolve any issues that arise when upgrading.
