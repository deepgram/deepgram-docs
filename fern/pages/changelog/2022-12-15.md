We’re excited to announce a new beta feature: Smart Format!

Smart Format makes transcripts easy to read. It adds punctuation; formats things like dates, addresses, and tracking numbers; splits up transcripts for pre-recorded audio into paragraphs; and more.

To get started, just specify smart_format=true in your batch or live-stream API request. We’ll be improving the results and adding even more formatting goodness to this feature over the coming months, so stay tuned.
