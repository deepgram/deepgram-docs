`model = nova-2-medical`

Deepgram has done additional training to our Nova-2 Medical Model to improve accuracy and expand the model vocabulary - resulting in a 16% relative improvement in word recall rate (WRR) on key medical terminology.

See our docs for the full list of models available: [https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/models-languages-overview](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/models-languages-overview#nova-2)

There should be no code changes required on your end - all requests with model=nova-2-medical will automatically get the latest version with the fix applied.

For On-Premises customers, please reach out to your Deepgram contact if you'd like to update your models.
