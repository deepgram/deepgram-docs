### This Release Contains The Following Changes

- [Improves profanity filtering](https://deepgram.com/changelog/improved-profanity-filtering).  No model update is required. Use the request parameter `profanity_filter=true`.
- Increases robustness of handling TTS text inputs.
- Adds new [streaming latency metrics](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/metrics-guide#streaming-latency-metrics) for monitoring latency in Grafana or similar applications.
- Reminder: The Deepgram image repositories have been updated to reflect our "self-hosted" naming. Images should now be pulled from the `self-hosted-*` Quay repositories. For the next eight months, both `onprem-*` and `self-hosted-*` image repositories will receive identical image updates monthly, and we will announce image tags in the `self-hosted` repositories. Subsequently, we will only publish new images to `self-hosted-*` repos, deprecating `onprem-*` repository variants.
- Keeps our software up-to-date.
