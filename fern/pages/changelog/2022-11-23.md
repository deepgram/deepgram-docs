Deepgram is excited to announce expanding our newest, most powerful ASR model tier, Enhanced, to include Hindi to bring you the highest accuracy for Hindi support.

For example, to call the Hindi model, the URL query might look like:

`*https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=general&tier=enhanced&language=hi&punctuate=true*`

To learn more about the various parameters you can use to customize your transcriptions with Deepgram, check out the list of Deepgram’s[ features in our documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/features-overview). 

Before using the new model in production, we recommend testing it alongside your typical feature adds, like keywords. Model updates may change transcription outputs.
