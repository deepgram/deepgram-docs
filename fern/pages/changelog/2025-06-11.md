### Profanity Filtering Gets Expanded Language Support

Profanity filtering now supports **6 additional languages** beyond English, giving you content moderation capabilities across your global user base. Available on monolingual models for:

**Newly Supported:**

- German (`de`)
- Swiss German (`de-CH`)
- Polish (`pl`)
- Portuguese (`pt`, `pt-BR`, `pt-PT`)
- Spanish (`es`, `es-419`)
- Swedish (`sv`, `sv-SE`)

**Existing English Support:**

- `en`, `en-US`, `en-AU`, `en-GB`, `en-NZ`, `en-IN`

This expansion lets you deploy consistent content policies across international markets without building custom filtering logic.

### Smart Formatting Improvements

We've resolved several high-impact formatting edge cases that were causing transcription accuracy issues in production environments:

### Improved Entity Formatting via Smart Format

**Email Transcription Improvements**

- **Fixed:** `'o'` characters in email addresses now transcribe correctly instead of converting to `'0'`
- **Fixed:** edge case email mentions that were being dropped entirely in specific batch processing scenarios

**Certain formerly numeric-only sequences have been updated to correctly preserve all alphanumeric characters:**

- Before (some entities): `"my account number is a b c d zero nine"` → `"my account number is 09"`
- After (some entities): `"my account number is a b c d zero nine"` → `"my account number is ABCD09"`

**Quantity modifiers ('single', 'double', 'triple' + standalone character or number) are better handled via Smart Format:**

- Before (some entities): `"double 2"` → `"2"`
- After (some entities): `"double 2"` → `"22"`

**Special cases of 'hundred' or 'a hundred' now supported via Smart Format:**

- Before (some entities): `"hundred percent"` → `"%"`
- After (some entities): `"hundred percent"` → `"100%"`

This update has gone out to all hosted streaming transcription, and will be applied to our next self-hosted release later this month.
