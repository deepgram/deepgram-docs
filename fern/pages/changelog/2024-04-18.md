Deepgram Aura text-to-speech has resolved user-reported issues, including:



Quotation Mark Handling

- You can now include quotation marks (" ") in the text-input, and it correctly pronounces words.



Empty Audio Outputs

- Previously, our TTS API in rare occasions produced empty audio outputs despite non-empty text-inputs. This issue has been resolved.
