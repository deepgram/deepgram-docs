### This Release Contains The Following Changes

- More control with language detection features! You can now [restrict which languages can be detected](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/language-detection#restricting-the-detectable-languages), and view the [language detection confidence score](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/language-detection#how-to-use-language_confidence) in returned ASR results.
- Adjusted order of operations with [async requests](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/callback) to more consistently return a request ID immediately.
- Improved model loading logic. If you have explicit model loading directives under the features section of your `engine.toml` configuration file, you can remove it when upgrading to more recent releases.
- The minimum supported CUDA runtime version for onprem-engine has changed from 11.3.1 to 12.1.1. Systems using NVIDIA drivers before version 525.60.13 might encounter errors when attempting to start this release of onprem-engine. Deepgram recommends installing the latest NVIDIA drivers for maximum compatibility, stability, and performance.
- Stability improvements, security patches, and bug fixes.üêõ
