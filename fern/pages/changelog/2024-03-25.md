### This Release Contains The Following Changes

- ‚ùóTo support our new token-based features when upgrading from the January 2024 release or earlier (`240104`), the License Proxy container (and Billing container, if using) must be updated either alongside or in advance of the Engine and API containers. Deepgram recommends a blue-green deployment of the License Proxy container if deploying concurrently. You will experience a service outage if you attempt to run the new Engine and API containers before the License Proxy container is updated. Please see [the linked PDF](https://static.deepgram.com/examples/Deepgram-February-2024-onprem-release-240228.pdf) for deployment recommendations.
- Audio transcoding improvements.
- Stability improvements, security patches, and bug fixes.üêõ
