Deepgram’s [live streaming transcription API](https://developers.deepgram.com/documentation/getting-started/streaming/) has been updated for enhanced usability.

Deepgram will now return the request ID and any applicable error messages in the headers for the pre-WebSocket HTTP connection created for all streaming requests.

The request ID is stored in the HTTP header named dg-request-id. This header is present in all requests, regardless of success or failure.

In case of request failure, an additional HTTP header named dg-error will be included with the body of the error.

Here’s an example of accessing this information using the Python websocket library:

Please note: if using Javascript in the browser, HTTP header information is not accessible due to inherent limitations in the Javascript WebSocket API. However, the headers are accessible if using NodeJS.
