We're excited to announce the release of our first domain-specific language model (DSLM) for speech summarization of call center interactions.

You can request our new Summarization API  endpoint by adding a summarize parameter set to v2 in the API call. It will then return a summary object in the response body of the output. The summary object includes status and a concise summary of the entire conversation.

The URL query to call the DSLM-powered Summarization API might look like this:

https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?summarize=v2

Example curl request:

You can send requests to the API with an Authorization header that references your project's API key

- Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY

The output response will contain the generated summary based on the provided audio. Summarization V2  supports English and Pre-Recorded audio.

Primary difference between V1 (summarize=true) and V2 (summarize=v2)

- V1 provides summaries per channel. V2 provides a single summary across all the channels.
- V1 response contains summary objects (with summary, start, and end word). V2 response contains a single object with result and short key.

We are thrilled to get this feature into your hands and await your feedback. Please share it with us at [Product Feedback](https://dgbetafeedback.ideas.aha.io/ideas/new) or your dedicated support channel.
