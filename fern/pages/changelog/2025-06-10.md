### This Release Contains The Following Changes

- Adds full support for Voice Agent [v1 API](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/voice-agent-v1-migration).
- Addresses an issue with the `engine_active_requests` metric for streaming STT auto-scaling.
- Resolves an issue with year formatting for `smart_format.`
- Keeps our software up-to-date.

**Reminder**: The Deepgram image repositories have been updated to reflect our "self-hosted" naming. Images should now be pulled from the `self-hosted-*` Quay repositories. For the next four months, both `onprem-*` and `self-hosted-*` image repositories will receive identical image updates monthly, and we will announce image tags in the `self-hosted` repositories. Subsequently, we will only publish new images to `self-hosted-*` repos, deprecating `onprem-*` repository variants.
