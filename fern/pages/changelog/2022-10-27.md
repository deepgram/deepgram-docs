We’ve made a change in our recently released Diarizer that may affect you. Requests for very long audio files for the new diarizer (files longer than 3 hours) will temporarily return an error message with a 400 error code. The team is actively working to enable diarization for files longer than three hours.

### Here is a workaround to help you while our team works to remedy this behavior

- If your audio file is longer than 3 hours, you can use the old diarizer by adding an additional query parameter to your requests – *diarizer_version=2021-7-14.0*
  - https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?diarize=true&diarize_version=2021-07-14.0


- If your audio file is shorter than 3 hours, no change is necessary. Your API requests with diarization will return results as expected.

### Who isn’t impacted by this change

- Users processing audio with diarization (diarize=true) and a duration of less than 3 hours.
- On-prem customers.

Our customer [support](mailto:support@deepgram.com) team is always available to work with you on any issues you may see with our latest version of the diarizer.
