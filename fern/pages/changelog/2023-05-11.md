We are thrilled to release the enhanced version of our Automatic Language Detection feature (detect_language=true), now supporting over 15+ languages. Deepgram’s Enhanced Language Detection is adept at identifying the primary language in an audio file and providing transcriptions in the detected language.

To utilize the Language Detection API, simply use the following URL query format: 

`https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?detect_language=true&punctuate=true`

The API Response will output the detected language. For example – *“detected_language”: “es”*

To learn more about the various parameters you can use to customize your transcriptions with Deepgram, check out the list of Deepgram’s[ features in our documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/features-overview).
