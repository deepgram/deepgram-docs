Deepgram has released a change to how we report errors during Realtime Streaming. Now, we will return a WebSocket Close frame and the body of the Close frame will indicate the reason for closing using one of the specification’s [pre-defined status codes](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-7.4.1) followed by a UTF-8-encoded payload that represents the reason for the error.

[Read about the error handling here.](https://developers.deepgram.com/reference/streaming#error-handling)

Deepgram support, [**support@deepgram.com**](mailto:support@deepgram.com), is always available to help.
