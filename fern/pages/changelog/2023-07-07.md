Deepgram recommends installing the latest NVIDIA drivers for maximum compatibility, stability, and performance.
  - The onprem-engine container size has been significantly reduced.


- Reduction in frequency of hallucinations when using Deepgram enhanced models.
- Improvements to accuracy of reported word times when using existing Whisper models.
- Duration values specified in the onprem-api configuration file can now include unit suffixes. For example, instead of writing 480 it is now possible to write 4m. Values with no suffix are assumed to be seconds.
