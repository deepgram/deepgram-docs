In this guide, we'll explain how to set up the integration in your AWS environment and build a basic voice agent with Amazon Bedrock.

<Info>
  Before you can use Deepgram, you'll need to [create a Deepgram account](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys). Signup is free and includes **$200** in free credit and access to all of Deepgram's features!

## Before you Begin

<Info>
  Before you start, you'll need to follow the steps in the [Make Your First API Request](/docs/make-your-first-api-request) guide to obtain a Deepgram API key, and configure your environment if you are choosing to use a Deepgram SDK.

## Set Up Amazon Bedrock

To use Amazon Bedrock with Deepgram, you'll need to set up Amazon Bedrock as your LLM provider. [This guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) will walk you through the steps.

## Guide Overview

This guide demonstrates how to:

- Capture microphone audio in the browser
- Stream audio to Deepgram’s Voice Agent API
- Use Amazon Bedrock as your LLM provider to answer some medical questions
- Play back generated audio responses

By the end, you’ll have a basic HTML/JS client that you can use to test out your Amazon Bedrock LLM with Deepgram.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 14.x
- A Deepgram API key
- An Amazon Bedrock LLM endpoint to use for your voice agent
- Familiarity with JavaScript and HTML
- Familiarity with Amazon Bedrock
- Understanding of how to use the [Deepgram Voice Agent API](/docs/configure-voice-agent)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Client Repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/deepgram-devs/amazon-bedrock-agent-demo
cd amazon-bedrock-agent-demo
```
### 2. Clone the Bedrock LLM Client Proxy Repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/deepgram-devs/deepgram-voice-agent-client-llm-proxy
cd deepgram-voice-agent-client-llm-proxy
```

### 3. Set Up the Client

Follow the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/amazon-bedrock-agent-demo/blob/main/README.md) to set up the client repo.

### 4. Set Up the LLM Proxy

<Info>
If you already have a Bedrock LLM endpoint and proxy, you can skip this step.
