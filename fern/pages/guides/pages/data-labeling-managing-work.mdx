## Selecting Files

![](./76085a8-image.png)

Deepgram best practices require that all audio files be reviewed by four independent users. Hotpepper implements the idea of independent reviewers through the concept of levels, each of which represents a queue of unlabeled files that require different levels of effort. To learn more about Deepgramâ€™s suggested ordering of operations, visit [Understanding the Workflow](/data-labeling-understanding-the-workflow).

To select a file:

Select the level that corresponds to the desired review level. The system will automatically assign you a file from the selected queue and take you to the labeling view for the assigned file.

<Info>
While reviewing, you can pause your work before completion. If you have previously paused a file at the selected level, the system will automatically load the paused file into the labeling view, so you can finish your work.
</Info>

<Info>
Once you have finished labeling a file and marked it as done, the file is added to the queue for the next labeling level, and you will no longer be able to see it.
