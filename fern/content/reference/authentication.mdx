Deepgram's API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You must include an API key in the `Authorization` header of every request to access the API.

## Authentication Method

Deepgram supports authentication via API keys. These keys should be included in the `Authorization` header using the following format:

```http
Authorization: token YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen" \
     -H "Authorization: token YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --data '{"url":"https://dpgr.am/spacewalk.wav"}'
```

## Obtaining an API Key

To obtain an API key:

1. Sign in to your Deepgram account.
2. Navigate to the **API Keys** section in your dashboard.
3. Click **Generate API Key** and copy the key for use in API requests.

## Security Considerations

- **Keep your API key private**. Do not expose it in public repositories or client-side code.
- **Use environment variables** to store API keys securely.
- **Rotate API keys regularly** for security best practices.

## Error Handling

If authentication fails, the API will return a `401 Unauthorized` error:

```json
{
  "err_code": "INVALID_AUTH",
  "err_msg": "Invalid credentials.",
  "request_id": "<unique-request-id>"
}
```

Make sure:
- Your API key is correct and active.
- You are including the `Authorization` header properly.
