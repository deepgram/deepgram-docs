This guide will help you make your first transcription request to the Deepgram’s Speech-to-Text API.

## Basic Transcription

Here's a simple example of transcribing an audio file:


<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /v1/listen" />

## Transcribing from a URL

You can also transcribe audio from a URL:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen" \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://dpgr.am/spacewalk.wav"}'
```

## Understanding the Response

The API will return a JSON response with the transcription and additional metadata:

<EndpointResponseSnippet endpoint="POST /v1/listen" />
