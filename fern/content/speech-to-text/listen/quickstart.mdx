This guide will help you make your first transcription request to the Deepgram’s Speech-to-Text API.

## Basic Transcription

Here's a simple example of transcribing an audio file:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /v1/listen" />

## Transcribing from a URL

You can also transcribe audio from a URL:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /v1/listen" example="ExampleWithMarkley" />

## Understanding the Response

The API will return a JSON response with the transcription and additional metadata:

<EndpointResponseSnippet endpoint="POST /v1/listen" />
