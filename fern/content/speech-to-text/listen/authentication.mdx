The Deepgram’s Speech-to-Text API uses API keys for authentication. You'll need to include your API key in all requests to the API.

## Getting Your API Key

1. Log in to your Deepgram account
2. Navigate to the API Keys section
3. Create a new API key or use an existing one

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of your requests:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /v1/listen" />
