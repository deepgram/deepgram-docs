title: Text To Speech REST
subtitle: An overview of the Deepgram Python SDK and Deepgram text-to-speech.
slug: docs/python-sdk-text-to-speech
---


The Deepgram [`Speak Clients`](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/tree/main/deepgram/clients/speak/v1/rest) allows you to generate human-like audio from text.

<Info>
  This SDK supports both the Threaded and Async/Await Clients as described in the [Threaded and Async IO Task Support](/docs/threaded-and-async-io-task-support) section. The code blocks contain a tab for `Threaded` and `Async` to show examples for `rest` versus `asyncrest`, respectively. The difference between `Threaded` and `Async` is subtle.

## Installing the SDK

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  # Install the Deepgram Python SDK
  # https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk

  pip install deepgram-sdk==3.*
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Make a Deepgram Text-to-Speech Request

The Deepgram [`Speak Clients`](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/tree/main/deepgram/clients/speak/v1/rest) allow you to create audio generated from provided text, also known as text-to-speech.

There are two functions provided to translate text-to-speech:

* `stream()` - This takes the resulting audio and holds it in memory via `io.BytesIO`.
* `save()` or `file()` - These save the audio stream to a user provided filename.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Threaded
  import os
  from deepgram import DeepgramClient, SpeakOptions

  SPEAK_OPTIONS = {"text": "Hello, how can I help you today?"}
  filename = "output.mp3"

  def main():
      try:
          # STEP 1: Create a Deepgram client.
          # By default, the DEEPGRAM_API_KEY environment variable will be used for the API Key
          deepgram = DeepgramClient()

          # STEP 2: Configure the options (such as model choice, audio configuration, etc.)
          options = SpeakOptions(
              model="aura-asteria-en",
          )

          # STEP 3: Call the save method on the speak property
          response = deepgram.speak.rest.v("1").save(filename, SPEAK_OPTIONS, options)
          print(response.to_json(indent=4))

      except Exception as e:
          print(f"Exception: {e}")

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()
  ```

  ```python Async
  import asyncio
  from deepgram import DeepgramClient, SpeakOptions

  SPEAK_OPTIONS = {"text": "Hello, how can I help you today?"}
  filename = "output.mp3"

  async def main():
      try:
          # STEP 1: Create a Deepgram client.
          # By default, the DEEPGRAM_API_KEY environment variable will be used for the API Key
          deepgram = DeepgramClient()

          # STEP 2: Configure the options (such as model choice, audio configuration, etc.)
          options = SpeakOptions(
              model="aura-asteria-en",
          )

          # STEP 3: Call the save method on the speak property
          response = await deepgram.speak.asyncrest.v("1").save(filename, SPEAK_OPTIONS, options)
          print(response.to_json(indent=4))

      except Exception as e:
          print(f"Exception: {e}")

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      asyncio.run(main())
  ```

## Audio Output Streaming

Deepgram's TTS API allows you to start playing the audio once the first byte is received. This section provides examples to help you stream the audio output efficiently.

### Single Text Source Payload

The following example demonstrates how to stream the audio as soon as the first byte arrives for a single text source.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Threaded
  import re
  from deepgram import Deepgram
  import requests

  DEEPGRAM_API_KEY = 'YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY'
  deepgram = Deepgram(DEEPGRAM_API_KEY)

  inputText = "Your long text goes here..."

  def segmentTextBySentence(text):
      return re.findall(r"[^.!?]+[.!?]", text)

  def synthesizeAudio(text):
      options = SpeakOptions(
          model="aura-asteria-en",
      )

      response = deepgram.speak.rest.v("1").stream(filename, SPEAK_OPTIONS, options)

      if response.status_code == 200:
          return response.content
      else:
          raise Exception('Error generating audio')

  def main():
      segments = segmentTextBySentence(inputText)

      for i, segment in enumerate(segments):
          try:
              audioData = synthesizeAudio(segment)
              with open(f"output_{i}.wav", 'wb') as f:
                  f.write(audioData)
              print(f"Audio stream finished for segment: {segment}")
          except Exception as error:
              print(f"Error synthesizing audio: {error}")

      print("Audio file creation completed.")

  main()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Chunked Text Source Payload

This example shows how to chunk the text source by sentence boundaries and stream the audio for each chunk consecutively.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Threaded
  import re
  from deepgram import Deepgram
  import requests

  DEEPGRAM_API_KEY = 'YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY'
  deepgram = Deepgram(DEEPGRAM_API_KEY)

  inputText = "Your long text goes here..."

  def segmentTextBySentence(text):
      return re.findall(r"[^.!?]+[.!?]", text)

  def synthesizeAudio(text):
      options = SpeakOptions(
          model="aura-asteria-en",
      )

      response = deepgram.speak.rest.v("1").stream(filename, SPEAK_OPTIONS, options)

      if response.status_code == 200:
          return response.content
      else:
          raise Exception('Error generating audio')

  def main():
      segments = segmentTextBySentence(inputText)

      for i, segment in enumerate(segments):
          try:
              audioData = synthesizeAudio(segment)
              with open(f"output_{{i}}.wav", 'wb') as f:
                  f.write(audioData)
              print(f"Audio stream finished for segment: {{segment}}")
          except Exception as error:
              print(f"Error synthesizing audio: {{error}}")

      print("Audio file creation completed.")

  main()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Where to Find Additional Examples

The SDK repository has a good collection of text-to-speech examples. The [README](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#examples) contains links to them. Each example below attempts to provide different options for transcribing an audio source.

Some Examples:

* Threaded Client speaking "Hello World" - [examples/text-to-speech/rest/file/hello\_world](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/blob/main/examples/text-to-speech/rest/file/hello_world/main.py)

If the Async Client suits your use case better:

* Threaded Client speaking "Hello World" - [examples/text-to-speech/rest/file/async\_hello\_world](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/blob/main/examples/text-to-speech/rest/file/async_hello_world/main.py)
