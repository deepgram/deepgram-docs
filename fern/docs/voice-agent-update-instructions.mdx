# What is the `UpdateInstructions` Message

The `UpdateInstructions` message is a JSON command that you can use to give additional instructions to the Think model in the middle of a conversation.

## Sending `UpdateInstructions`

To send the `UpdateInstructions` message, you need to send the following JSON message to the server:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
    "type": "UpdateInstructions",
    "instructions": "" // The new instructions to give  
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## `UpdateInstructions` Confirmation

Upon receiving the `UpdateInstructions` message, the server will process all remaining audio data and return the following:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
      "type": "InstructionsUpdated"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

# Conclusion

The `UpdateInstructions` message is a JSON command used to provide new or modified instructions to the Think model during an ongoing conversation, allowing real-time adjustments to the agent's behavior or response style. This can be used to dynamically adjust the behavior of the Think model mid-conversation. It allows for flexibility in tailoring responses, enabling the agent to adapt to changes in tone, context, or specific user needs without restarting the interaction. This can improve conversational flow and create a more personalized user experience.
