Client Messages are JSON-formatted commands that the client sends to the Deepgram server over the WebSocket connection during a voice agent interaction. These messages allow the client to control various aspects of the conversation, configure the agent, and provide necessary information.

## List of Client Messages

* `Settings Configuration`: Initializes the voice agent and sets up audio transmission formats before any voice data is exchanged. Docs
* `Update Instructions`: Allows giving additional instructions to the Think model in the middle of a conversation.
* `Update Speak`: Enables changing the Speak model during the conversation.
* `Inject Agent Message`: Triggers an immediate statement from the agent.
* `Function Call Response`: Sends the result of a function call back to the server.
* `Agent Keep Alive`: Maintains the connection to prevent timeouts.

For more detailed information on the format and usage of each message, refer to the individual documentation pages for each message.
