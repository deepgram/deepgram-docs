Client Messages are JSON-formatted commands that the client sends to the Deepgram server over the WebSocket connection during a voice agent interaction. These messages allow the client to control various aspects of the conversation, configure the agent, and provide necessary information.

## List of Client Messages

* [`Settings Configuration`](/docs/voice-agent-settings-configuration): Initializes the voice agent and sets up audio transmission formats before any voice data is exchanged.
* [`Update Instructions`](/docs/voice-agent-update-instructions): Allows giving additional instructions to the Think model in the middle of a conversation.
* [`Update Speak`](/docs/voice-agent-update-speak): Enables changing the Speak model during the conversation.
* [`Inject Agent Message`](/docs/voice-agent-inject-agent-message): Triggers an immediate statement from the agent.
* [`Function Call Response`](/docs/voice-agent-function-call-response): Sends the result of a function call back to the server.
* [`Agent Keep Alive`](/docs/agent-keep-alive): Maintains the connection to prevent timeouts.

For more detailed information on the format and usage of each message, refer to the individual documentation pages for each message.
