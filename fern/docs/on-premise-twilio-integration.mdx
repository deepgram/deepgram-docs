title: Twilio and Deepgram STT
subtitle: >-
  A starter server and a self-hosted solution for integrating speech-to-text
  with Twilio and Deepgram.
slug: docs/on-premise-twilio-integration
---


Integrate Twilio with Deepgram for real-time automatic speech recognition in Programmable Voice calls.

## Before you Begin

<Info>
  Before you can use Deepgram, you'll need to [create a Deepgram account](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys). Signup is free and includes **$200** in free credit and access to all of Deepgram's features!
</Info>

<Info>
  Before you start, you'll need to follow the steps in the [Make Your First API Request](/docs/make-your-first-api-request) guide to obtain a Deepgram API key, and configure your environment if you are choosing to use a Deepgram SDK.
</Info>

## Solutions

To help you integrate between Twilio and Deepgram, we provide the following solutions:

* A **starter server** in either Python or Node. A conversation streamed to your Twilio number will be directed to our script, which will send the audio to Deepgram, and receive and print transcriptions to the screen. In a real implementation, you will likely want to provide a callback to which transcriptions can be sent.

* A **Docker image** (`deepgram/twilio-proxy:beta`) that fully integrates with our self-hosted products using the same robust Rust architecture that our other services use. For access to the Docker image, ask your Account Executive.

### Starter Server

<Info>
  The code for the starter server can be accessed in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/deepgram/public-code-examples).
</Info>

For our starter server, we offer two scripts that can work as proxy servers to help Twilio and Deepgram share data.

* `twilio-proxy-mono`: Runs the proxy server for the inbound Twilio track, which represents the audio Twilio receives from the call. To learn more about Twilio tracks, see [Twilio’s track documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/stream#attributes-track).

* `twilio-proxy-stereo`: Runs the proxy server for both the inbound and outbound Twilio tracks, which represent the audio Twilio received from the call and the audio generated by Twilio to the call. To learn more about Twilio tracks, see [Twilio’s track documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/stream#attributes-track).

#### Before You Begin

##### Create a Deepgram Account and Get Your Deepgram API Key

Before you can use Deepgram products, you'll need to [create a Deepgram account](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys). After you've signed up for your free account, [create a Deepgram API Key](/docs/authenticating/#create-an-api-key). Make note of your API Key; you will need it later.

##### Create a Twilio Account

Before you can use Twilio products, you'll need to [create a Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio). In addition, if you don't currently own a Twilio phone number with Voice functionality, you'll need to purchase one.

##### Configure Environment

We provide sample scripts in Python and Node format and assume you have already configured a Python (3.6 or greater) or Node development environment.

##### Install Dependencies

For Python, we use [websockets](https://pypi.org/project/websockets/) and [pydub](https://pypi.org/project/pydub/).

For Node, we use [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws).

#### Configure the Scripts

Prior to running the scripts, you must replace the authentication with your Deepgram username and password.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  'Authorization': 'Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY'
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript
  const deepgramApiKey = "INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Run the Scripts

To run the scripts:

1. [Clone the GitHub repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to your local machine.

2. From the command line, navigate to the cloned repository.

3. Run the script using one of the following commands:

**Mono**

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Python
  python3 twilio-proxy-mono.py
  ```

  ```shell JavaScript
  node twilio-proxy-mono.js
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Stereo**

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  python3 twilio-proxy-stereo.py
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript
  node twilio-proxy-stereo.js
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Forward Data to Proxy

Finally, you will need to forward data to the proxy scripts. You can do this by configuring Twilio to send WebSockets data to the server running the proxy scripts or by initiating a call between two people and directly forwarding the data to the proxy scripts.

##### Configure Twilio to Use WebSockets

See the [Start Streaming Audio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/tutorials/consume-real-time-media-stream-using-websockets-python-and-flask#start-streaming-audio) section of Twilio’s tutorial: "Consume a real-time Media Stream using WebSockets, Python, and Flask". In this tutorial, you will use [TwiML Bins](https://www.twilio.com/docs/runtime/tutorials/twiml-bins), a serverless solution that helps you provide Twilio-hosted instructions to your Twilio applications, to begin streaming your call's audio.

When calling your Twilio number, the call will be forwarded to the number you set in your TwiML Bin. The conversation will then be forked to the `twilio-proxy-mono` or `twilio-proxy-stereo` app, which will send the audio to Deepgram, receive transcriptions, and print the transcriptions to the screen. In a real implementation, you will likely want to provide a callback to which transcriptions can be sent.

Sample TwiML Bin files are as follows:

**Mono**

<CodeGroup>
  ```xml XML
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <Response>
      <Start>
          <Stream url="wss://my-server-address" />
       </Start>
       <Dial>my-phone-number</Dial>
  </Response>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Stereo**

For stereo, an additional `track` parameter exists.

<CodeGroup>
  ```xml XML
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <Response>
      <Start>
          <Stream url="wss://my-server-address" track="both_tracks" />
       </Start>
       <Dial>my-phone-number</Dial>
  </Response>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

##### Send Call Data to Proxy Scripts

Alternatively, you can initiate a call between two people and forward the call data to the Twilio-Deepgram proxy (as seen in the Twilio + Deepgram demo) using the script in [`twilio/twilio-api-scripts/stream`](https://github.com/deepgram/public-code-examples/blob/master/twilio/python/twilio-api-scripts/stream.py):

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  # twilio helper library
  from twilio.rest import Client

  # other imports
  import time
  import requests
  import json
  import os
  import uuid

  # your account sid and auth token from twilio.com/console
  account_sid = os.environ['TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID']
  auth_token = os.environ['TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN']
  # the twilio client
  client = Client(account_sid, auth_token)
  # make the outgoing call
  call = client.calls.create(
    twiml = '<Response><Start><Stream url="wss://url.to.deepgram.twilio.proxy" track="both_tracks" /></Start><Dial>+11231231234</Dial></Response>', # replace number with person B, replace url
    to = '+11231231234', # person A
    from_ = '+11231231234' # your twilio number
  )
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript
  // Twilio helper library
  const twilio = require("twilio");

  // Your account SID and auth token from twilio.com/console
  const accountSid = process.env.TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID;
  const authToken = process.env.TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN;

  // The Twilio client
  const client = twilio(accountSid, authToken);

  // Make the outgoing call
  client.calls
    .create({
      twiml:
        '<Response><Start><Stream url="wss://url.to.deepgram.twilio.proxy" track="both_tracks" /></Start><Dial>+11231231234</Dial></Response>', // replace number with person B, replace url
      to: "+11231231234", // person A
      from: "+11231231234", // your Twilio number
    })
    .then((call) => console.log(call.sid))
    .catch((err) => console.error(err));
  ```
</CodeGroup>

* Be sure to replace `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` with your Twilio account information.
* Replace the `url` variable with the URL to the Deepgram-Twilio proxy server, and the Dial number with person B's phone number.
* Replace the `to` and `from_` variables with person A's phone number, and your Twilio voice number, respectively.

### Docker Image

We provide the Docker image `deepgram/twilio-proxy:beta`, which you can request from your Account Executive.

<Warning>
  This solution is for Deepgram's self-hosted customers. Please [contact us](https://deepgram.com/contact-us) if you would like to learn more about our self-hosted solutions.
</Warning>

#### Before You Begin

##### Create a Deepgram Account

Before you can use Deepgram products, you'll need to [create a Deepgram account](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys).

##### Create a Twilio Account

#### Run the Docker Image

We recommend running the Twilio-proxy server in a Docker container configured using a Docker Compose file. We provide the following sample Compose files to show you how to do this for a Deepgram API using either our hosted or self-hosted deployment models.

##### Self-Hosted

To deploy the Twilio proxy server to a self-hosted Deepgram environment using Docker Compose, you can use the following sample Compose file.

<Info>
  This sample references stubbed out `api` and `engine` sections. Fill in these sections with the template in the [`deepgram-self-hosted` repository](https://github.com/deepgram/self-hosted-resources/blob/main/docker/docker-compose.standard.yml). To learn more, see the [Self-Hosted Introduction](/docs/self-hosted-introduction) and other self-hosted guides, or talk to your Account Executive.
</Info>

<Info>
  This sample references the `deepgram/actix-ws-echo:beta` Docker image, which is a WebSockets echo server. You can use it to see streaming Deepgram STT responses, or you can configure a callback URL to send Deepgram STT responses elsewhere.

#### Forward Data to Proxy

Finally, you will need to forward data to the Twilio-Deepgram proxy. You can do this by configuring Twilio to send WebSockets data to the server running the Twilio-Deepgram proxy or by initiating a call between two people and directly forwarding the data to the Twilio-Deepgram proxy.

##### Configure Twilio to Use WebSockets

To user the Docker Image, you must configure Twilio to forward data to the server serving the Rust program. To do this, see the [Start Streaming Audio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/tutorials/consume-real-time-media-stream-using-websockets-python-and-flask#start-streaming-audio) section of Twilio’s tutorial: Consume a real-time Media Stream using WebSockets, Python, and Flask. In this tutorial, you will use [TwiML Bins](https://www.twilio.com/docs/runtime/tutorials/twiml-bins), a serverless solution that helps you provide Twilio-hosted instructions to your Twilio applications, to begin streaming your call's audio.

When calling your Twilio number, the call will be forwarded to the number you set in your TwiML Bin. The conversation will then be forked to the Twilio-Deepgram proxy app, which will send the audio to Deepgram, receive transcriptions, and print the transcriptions to the screen. In a real implementation, you will likely want to provide a callback to which transcriptions can be sent.

Sample TwiML Bin files are as follows:

**Mono**

<CodeGroup>
  ```xml XML
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <Response>
      <Start>
          <Stream url="wss://my-server-address" />
       </Start>
       <Dial>my-phone-number</Dial>
  </Response>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Stereo**

For stereo, an additional `track` parameter exists.

<CodeGroup>
  ```xml XML
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <Response>
      <Start>
          <Stream url="wss://my-server-address" track="both_tracks" />
       </Start>
       <Dial>my-phone-number</Dial>
  </Response>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

##### Send Call Data to Twilio-Deepgram Proxy

Alternatively, you can initiate a call between two people and forward the call data to the Twilio-Deepgram proxy (as seen in the Twilio + Deepgram demo) using the script in [`twilio/twilio-api-scripts/stream.py`](https://github.com/deepgram/public-code-examples/tree/master/twilio/twilio-api-scripts):

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  # twilio helper library
  from twilio.rest import Client

  # other imports
  import time
  import requests
  import json
  import os
  import uuid

  # your account sid and auth token from twilio.com/console
  account_sid = os.environ['TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID']
  auth_token = os.environ['TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN']
  # the twilio client
  client = Client(account_sid, auth_token)
  # make the outgoing call
  call = client.calls.create(
    twiml = '<Response><Start><Stream url="wss://url.to.deepgram.twilio.proxy" track="both_tracks" /></Start><Dial>+11231231234</Dial></Response>', # replace number with person B, replace url
    to = '+11231231234', # person A
    from_ = '+11231231234' # your twilio number
  )
  ```
</CodeGroup>

* Be sure to replace `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` with your Twilio account information.
* Replace the `url` variable with the URL to the Deepgram-Twilio proxy server, and the Dial number with person B's phone number.
* Replace the `to` and `from_` variables with person A's phone number, and your Twilio voice number, respectively.
