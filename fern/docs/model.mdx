## Models & Model Options

Below are a list of all model and model options that can be used with the Deepgram API.

### Nova-3

**Examples**

```
https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova-3
```

Nova-3 represents a significant leap forward in speech AI technology, featuring substantial improvements in accuracy and real-world application capabilities. The model delivers industry-leading performance with a 53.4% reduction in word error rate (WER) for streaming and 47.4% for batch processing compared to competitors. Nova-3 introduces groundbreaking features including real-time multilingual conversation transcription, enhanced comprehension of domain-specific terminology, and optional personal information redaction. Notably, it's the first voice AI model to offer self-serve customization, enabling instant vocabulary adaptation without model retraining. In multilingual testing, Nova-3 demonstrated superior performance across all seven tested languages, with particularly strong results showing up to 8:1 preference ratios in certain languages.

<Info>
  Nova-3 has the following model options which can be called by using the following syntax: `model=nova-3-{option}`
</Info>

* `general`: Optimized for everyday audio processing.

### Nova-2

**Examples**

<CodeGroup>
  ```text Text
  https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova-2
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup>
  ```text Text
  https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova-2-phonecall
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Nova-2 expands on Nova-1's advancements with speech-specific optimizations to the underlying Transformer architecture, advanced data curation techniques, and a multi-stage training methodology. These changes yield reduced word error rate (WER) and enhancements to entity recognition (i.e. proper nouns, alphanumerics, etc.), punctuation, and capitalization.

<Info>
  Nova-2 has the following model options which can be called by using the following syntax: `model=nova-2-{option}`
</Info>

* `general`: Optimized for everyday audio processing.
* `meeting`: Optimized for conference room settings, which include multiple speakers with a single microphone.
* `phonecall`: Optimized for low-bandwidth audio phone calls.
* `voicemail`: Optimized for low-bandwidth audio clips with a single speaker. Derived from the phonecall model.
* `finance`: Optimized for multiple speakers with varying audio quality, such as might be found on a typical earnings call. Vocabulary is heavily finance oriented.
* `conversationalai`: Optimized for use cases in which a human is talking to an automated bot, such as IVR, a voice assistant, or an automated kiosk.
* `video`: Optimized for audio sourced from videos.
* `medical`: Optimized for audio with medical oriented vocabulary.
* `drivethru`: Optimized for audio sources from drivethrus.
* `automotive`: Optimized for audio with automative oriented vocabulary.
* `atc`: Optimized for audio from air traffic control.

### Nova

**Examples**

<CodeGroup>
  ```text Text
  https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup>
  ```text Text
  https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova-phonecall
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Nova is the predecessor to Nova-2. Training on this model spans over 100 domains and 47 billion tokens, making it the deepest-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) model to date. Nova doesn't just excel in one specific domain — it is ideal for a wide array of voice applications that require high accuracy in diverse contexts.

<Info>
  Nova has the following model options which can be called by using the following syntax: `model=nova-{option}`
</Info>

* `general`: Optimized for everyday audio processing. Likely to be more accurate than any region-specific Base model for the language for which it is enabled. If you aren't sure which model to select, start here.

* `phonecall`: Optimized for low-bandwidth audio phone calls.

### Enhanced

**Examples**

<CodeGroup>
  ```text Text
  https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=enhanced
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup>
  ```text Text
  https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=enhanced-phonecall
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Enhanced models are still some of our most powerful speech-to-text models; they generally have higher accuracy and better word recognition than our base models, and they handle uncommon words significantly better.

<Info>
  Enhanced has the following model options which can be called by using the following syntax: `model=enhanced-{option}`
</Info>

* `general`: Optimized for everyday audio processing. Likely to be more accurate than any region-specific Base model for the language for which it is enabled. If you aren't sure which model to select, start here.

* `meeting` *beta*: Optimized for conference room settings, which include multiple speakers with a single microphone.

* `phonecall`: Optimized for low-bandwidth audio phone calls.

* `finance` *beta*: Optimized for multiple speakers with varying audio quality, such as might be found on a typical earnings call. Vocabulary is heavily finance oriented.

The Enhanced models can be called with the following syntax:

### Base

**Examples**

<CodeGroup>
  ```text Text
  https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=base
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup>
  ```text Text
  https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=base-phonecall
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Base models are built on our signature end-to-end deep learning speech-to-text model architecture. They offer a solid combination of accuracy and cost effectiveness in some cases.

<Info>
  Base has the following model options which can be called by using the following syntax: `model=base-{option}`
</Info>

* `general`: (Default) Optimized for everyday audio processing.
* `meeting`: Optimized for conference room settings, which include multiple speakers with a single microphone.
* `phonecall`: Optimized for low-bandwidth audio phone calls.
* `voicemail`: Optimized for low-bandwidth audio clips with a single speaker. Derived from the phonecall model.
* `finance`: Optimized for multiple speakers with varying audio quality, such as might be found on a typical earnings call. Vocabulary is heavily finance oriented.
* `conversationalai`: Optimized for use cases in which a human is talking to an automated bot, such as IVR, a voice assistant, or an automated kiosk.
* `video`: Optimized for audio sourced from videos.

### Custom

You may also use a custom, trained model associated with your account by including its `custom_id`.

<Info>
  Custom models are only available to Enterprise customers. See [Deepgram Pricing & Plans](https://deepgram.com/pricing/) for more details.

### Whisper

**Examples**

<CodeGroup>
  ```text Text
  https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=whisper
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup>
  ```text Text
  https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=whisper-SIZE
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Whisper models are less scalable than all other Deepgram models due to their inherent model architecture. All non-Whisper models will return results faster and scale to higher load.
</Warning>

Deepgram's Whisper Cloud is a fully managed API that gives you access to Deepgram's version of OpenAI’s Whisper model. Read our guide [Deepgram Whisper Cloud](/docs/deepgram-whisper-cloud) for a deeper dive into this offering.

Deepgram's Whisper models have the following size options:

* `tiny`: Contains 39 M parameters. The smallest model available.
* `base`: Contains 74 M parameters.
* `small`: Contains 244 M parameters.
* `medium`: Contains 769 M parameters. The default model if you don't specify a size.
* `large`: Contains 1550 M parameters. The largest model available. Defaults to OpenAI’s Whisper large-v2.

<Warning>
  Additional rate limits apply to Whisper due to poor scalability. Requests to Whisper are limited to 15 concurrent requests with a paid plan and 5 concurrent requests with the pay-as-you-go plan. Long audio files are supported up to a maximum of 20 minutes of processing time (the maximum length of the audio depends on the size of the Whisper model).
</Warning>

## Try it out
