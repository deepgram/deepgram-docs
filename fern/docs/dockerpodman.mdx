  in isolated environments. This guide section discusses running Deepgram
  products in a self-hosted environment using Docker or Podman.

## Should I use this for my self-hosted environment?

Docker and Podman are a simple, fast approach for deploying containers. They are best used in environments that require a small, static number of Deepgram containers. This may include development environments, proof-of-concept implementations, and production environments handling low levels of API traffic.

Larger production environments often have certain security, availability, and scaling requirements, such as:

* Fine-grained Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and other security policies
* Zero downtime maintenance and upgrades
* Auto-scaling system capacity based on system load

If any of the above apply to you, a [Kubernetes cluster](/docs/kubernetes) may better fulfill these requirements.
