The `Settings` message is a JSON command that serves as an initialization step, setting up both the behavior of the voice agent.

## Purpose

The `Settings` message is an initialization command that establishes both the behavior of the voice agent and the audio transmission formats before voice data is exchanged. The client should send a `Settings` message immediately after opening the websocket and before sending any audio.


<Info>
  For a detailed explanation of all the options available for the `Settings` message, see our documentation on how to [Configure the Voice Agent](/docs/configure-voice-agent).

## Example Payloads
This example uses a very basic `Settings` to establish a connection. To send the `Settings` message, you need to send the following JSON message to the server:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
{
  "type": "Settings",
  "audio": {
    "input": {
      "encoding": "linear16",
      "sample_rate": 24000
    },
    "output": {
      "encoding": "linear16",
      "sample_rate": 24000,
      "container": "none"
      // ... additional output options: bitrate
    }
  },
  "agent": {
    "language": "en",
    "listen": {
      "provider": {
        "type": "deepgram",
        "model": "nova-3"
        // ... additional provider options: keyterms (nova-3 'en' only)
      }
    },
    "think": {
      "provider": {
        "type": "open_ai",
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
        "temperature": 0.7
        // ... additional provider options: endpoint (for non-deepgram providers)
      },
      // ... additional think options: prompt, functions, endpoint
    },
    "speak": {
      "provider": {
        "type": "deepgram",
        "model": "aura-2-thalia-en"
        // ... additional provider options based on type:
        // - eleven_labs: model_id, language_code
        // - cartesia: model_id, voice (mode, id), language
        // - open_ai: voice
        // - aws_polly: engine, credentials, language_code, voice
      }
      // ... additional speak options: endpoint (for non-deepgram providers)
    }
    // ... additional agent options: greeting
  }
  // ... additional top-level options: experimental
}
```
</CodeGroup>


Upon receiving the `Settings` message, the server will process all remaining audio data and return the following [`SettingsApplied`](/docs/voice-agent-setting-applied-message) message.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
      "type": "SettingsApplied"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>
