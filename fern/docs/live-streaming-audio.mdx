  An introduction to getting transcription data from live streaming audio in
  real time.

<Markdown src="../snippets/streaming.mdx" />

In this guide, you'll learn how to automatically transcribe live streaming audio in real time using Deepgram's SDKs, which are supported for use with the [Deepgram API](/reference/). (If you prefer not to use a Deepgram SDK, jump to the section [Non-SDK Code Examples](/docs/getting-started-with-live-streaming-audio#non-sdk-code-examples).)

<Info>
  Before you start, you'll need to follow the steps in the [Make Your First API Request](/docs/make-your-first-api-request) guide to obtain a Deepgram API key, and configure your environment if you are choosing to use a Deepgram SDK.

## SDKs

To transcribe audio from an audio stream using one of Deepgram's SDKs, follow these steps.

### Install the SDK

Open your terminal, navigate to the location on your drive where you want to create your project, and install the Deepgram SDK.

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell JavaScript
  # Install the Deepgram JS SDK
  # https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-js-sdk

  npm install @deepgram/sdk
  ```

  ```shell Python
  # Install the Deepgram Python SDK
  # https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk

  pip install deepgram-sdk
  ```

  ```shell C#
  # Install the Deepgram .NET SDK
  # https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-dotnet-sdk

  dotnet add package Deepgram
  ```

  ```shell Go
  # Install the Deepgram Go SDK
  # https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk

  go get github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Add Dependencies

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell JavaScript
  # Install cross-fetch: Platform-agnostic Fetch API with typescript support, a simple interface, and optional polyfill.
  # Install dotenv to protect your api key

  npm install cross-fetch dotenv
  ```

  ```shell Python
  # Install python-dotenv to protect your API key

  pip install python-dotenv
  ```

  ```csharp C#
  // In your .csproj file, add the Package Reference:

  <ItemGroup>
      <PackageReference Include="Deepgram" Version="4.4.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
  ```

  ```shell Go
  # Importing the Deepgram Go SDK should pull in all dependencies required
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Transcribe Audio from a Remote Stream

The following code shows how to transcribe audio from a remote audio stream. If you would like to learn how to stream audio from a microphone, check out our [Live Audio Starter Apps](/docs/stt-streaming-feature-overview) or specific examples in the readme of each of the [Deepgram SDKs](/docs/deepgram-sdks).

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript JavaScript
  // Example filename: index.js

  const { createClient, LiveTranscriptionEvents } = require("@deepgram/sdk");
  const fetch = require("cross-fetch");
  const dotenv = require("dotenv");
  dotenv.config();

  // URL for the realtime streaming audio you would like to transcribe
  const url = "http://stream.live.vc.bbcmedia.co.uk/bbc_world_service";

  const live = async () => {
    // STEP 1: Create a Deepgram client using the API key
    const deepgram = createClient(process.env.DEEPGRAM_API_KEY);

    // STEP 2: Create a live transcription connection
    const connection = deepgram.listen.live({
      model: "nova-3",
      language: "en-US",
      smart_format: true,
    });

    // STEP 3: Listen for events from the live transcription connection
    connection.on(LiveTranscriptionEvents.Open, () => {
      connection.on(LiveTranscriptionEvents.Close, () => {
        console.log("Connection closed.");
      });

      connection.on(LiveTranscriptionEvents.Transcript, (data) => {
        console.log(data.channel.alternatives[0].transcript);
      });

      connection.on(LiveTranscriptionEvents.Metadata, (data) => {
        console.log(data);
      });

      connection.on(LiveTranscriptionEvents.Error, (err) => {
        console.error(err);
      });

      // STEP 4: Fetch the audio stream and send it to the live transcription connection
      fetch(url)
        .then((r) => r.body)
        .then((res) => {
          res.on("readable", () => {
            connection.send(res.read());
          });
        });
    });
  };

  live();

<Info>
  The above example includes the parameter `model=nova-3`, which tells the API to use Deepgram's latest model. Removing this parameter will result in the API using the default model, which is currently `model=base`.

  It also includes Deepgram's [Smart Formatting](/docs/smart-format) feature, `smart_format=true`. This will format currency amounts, phone numbers, email addresses, and more for enhanced transcript readability.
</Info>

## Non-SDK Code Examples

If you would like to try out making a Deepgram speech-to-text request in a specific language (but not using Deepgram's SDKs), we offer a library of code-samples in this [Github repo](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/code-samples). However, we recommend first trying out our SDKs.

## Results

In order to see the results from Deepgram, you must run the application. Run your application from the terminal. Your transcripts will appear in your shell.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript JavaScript
  # Run your application using the file you created in the previous step
  # Example: node index.js

  node YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.js
  ```

  ```shell Python
  # Run your application using the file you created in the previous step
  # Example: python main.py

  python YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.py
  ```

  ```shell C#
  # Run your application using the file you created in the previous step
  # Example: dotnet run Program.cs

  dotnet run YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.cs
  ```

  ```shell Go
  # Run your application using the file you created in the previous step
  # Example: go run main.go

  go run YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.go
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Deepgram does not store transcripts, so the Deepgram API response is the only opportunity to retrieve the transcript. Make sure to save output or [return transcriptions to a callback URL for custom processing](/docs/callback/).
</Warning>

### Analyze the Response

The responses that are returned will look similar to this:

In this default response, we see:

* `transcript`: the transcript for the audio segment being processed.

* `confidence`: a floating point value between 0 and 1 that indicates overall transcript reliability. Larger values indicate higher confidence.

* `words`: an object containing each `word` in the transcript, along with its `start` time and `end` time (in seconds) from the beginning of the audio stream, and a `confidence` value.

  * Because we passed the `smart_format: true` option to the `transcription.prerecorded` method, each word object also includes its `punctuated_word` value, which contains the transformed word after punctuation and capitalization are applied.

* `speech_final`: tells us this segment of speech naturally ended at this point. By default, Deepgram live streaming looks for any deviation in the natural flow of speech and returns a finalized response at these places. To learn more about this feature, see [Endpointing](/docs/endpointing/).

* `is_final`: If this says `false`, it is indicating that Deepgram will continue waiting to see if more data will improve its predictions. Deepgram live streaming can return a series of interim transcripts followed by a final transcript. To learn more, see [Interim Results](/docs/interim-results/).

<Info>
  Endpointing can be used with Deepgram's [Interim Results](/docs/interim-results/) feature. To compare and contrast these features, and to explore best practices for using them together, see [Using Endpointing and Interim Results with Live Streaming Audio](/docs/understand-endpointing-interim-results/).
</Info>

If your scenario requires you to keep the connection alive even while data is not being sent to Deepgram, you can send periodic KeepAlive messages to essentially "pause" the connection without closing it. To learn more, see [KeepAlive](/docs/keep-alive).
