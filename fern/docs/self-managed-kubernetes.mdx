title: Self-Managed Kubernetes
subtitle: >-
  You can deploy Deepgram using Kubernetes which will provide a scalable
  instance of Deepgram's API and Engine services running on your own hardware or
  in your Kubernetes cloud environment. In this guide, we will look at how to
  deploy Deepgram on-premises with Kubernetes on a system with a Ubuntu
  operating system installed. ​

---


## Prerequisites

Prior to deploying Kubernetes you will need to ensure you have a suitable environment per our [Deployment Environments](/docs/self-hosted-deployment-environments) guide. You will also need access to the [`deepgram-self-hosted` Helm chart](https://github.com/deepgram/self-hosted-resources/tree/main/charts/deepgram-self-hosted).

## Terminology

​If you are not overly familiar with Kubernetes, you should be aware of three main concepts:

* Node: A physical computer or virtual machine used to host workloads.
* Pod: A single container running on a node. One node can host many pods.
* Cluster: A group of nodes and their associated pods. ​ 

Additionally this guide refers frequently to `kubectl`, the [command line tool](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) for interacting with the Kubernetes clusters, `kubeadm`, the [cluster administration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/) tool, and the `kubelet` [node agent](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/). ​

## Installing Kubernetes

<Info>
  <h2> Managed Kubernetes </h2>
  If you are operating in a VPC, you should use a managed Kubernetes service instead of installing your own. For example, you can use [EKS in AWS](/docs/aws-k8s) as an alternative to the following manual installation.
</Info>

​Kubernetes consists of several components distributed as binaries or container images including an API server for cluster management, proxy server, scheduler, controllers, etc. These components are served from registry.k8s.io, and you will require several helper tools to get up and running including the aforementioned `kubectl`, `kubeadm`, and `kubelet`. ​ Prior to installing Kubernetes you **must** disable Linux swap permanently. While `sudo swapoff -a` will temporarily disable swap, you will need to make the change permenent in `/etc/fstab` or `systemd.swap`. ​

### Install kubeadm, kubelet and kubctl

Update your package repositories and install dependencies for the Kubernetes repository: ​

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl
  ```
</CodeGroup>

​ Download the public signing key from Google: ​

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl -fsSL https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg
  ```
</CodeGroup>

*Note: Distributions prior to 22.04 may not have the `/etc/apt/keyrings` folder. You can create this directory, making it world-readable and writeable only by admins.* ​ Add the Kubernetes official repository: ​

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
  ```
</CodeGroup>

​ Update packages and install Kubernetes tools: ​

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
  sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl
  ```
</CodeGroup>

​

<Warning>
  <h2> Kubernetes Versions </h2>
  When updating tooling you must use a kubectl version that is within one minor version difference of your cluster. For example, a v1.27 client can communicate with v1.26, v1.27, and v1.28 control planes. You must keep all tooling versions in sync manually. If you wish to pin the versions you can do so with `apt-mark` as follows:

  `sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl`​
</Warning>

### Initializing a Cluster

In order to run nodes and pods you must first create a cluster. This is done using the `kubeadm` command:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  kubeadm init --ignore-preflight-errors Swap
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Kubeadm will run verification checks and report any errors, then it will download the required containerized components and initialize a control-plane. You can see configuration options for initialization [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kubeadm-config.v1beta3/), including how set node taints.

Once the control-plane is initialized you will receive instructions to store the cluster configuration and deploy a pod network. Examples below (instructions may differ based on your system):

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You will also be presented with a `kubeadm join` command which should be saved for later use joining worker nodes to the master node. ​ Upon completion you should now be able to query your control-plan and see the standard Kubernetes pods running: ​

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  kubectl get pod -n kube-system
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Deploying a Containerized Network Interface

By default Kubernetes does not deploy a CNI for pod communication. Before cluster DNS will start and pods be able to communicate you must install an add-on for the CNI you wish to deploy in your cluster as follows: ​

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  kubectl apply -f <add-on.yaml>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

As an example, if you were to deploy the [Calico network](https://www.tigera.io/project-calico/) in your cluster you would install the add-on as follows: ​

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.25.0/manifests/calico.yaml
  ```
</CodeGroup>

A comprehensive though not exhaustive list of common network add-ons is available in the official Kuberenetes [Networking and Network Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/#networking-and-network-policy) documentation. You may utilize only a single CNI per cluster. ​ To verify the network is up and running you can check the CoreDNS pod status. When the CoreDNS pod state shows as `Running` you may then join nodes to the cluster. ​

#### Joining Nodes

Once the master node is setup you can begin joining worker nodes to the cluster. If you copied the join command output when the cluster was initialized this can be used on each worker node directly. In the event that you did not save the join command you may recover it using `kubeadm` as follows: ​

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  kubeadm token create --print-join-command
  ```
</CodeGroup>

After joining nodes to the cluster you can utilize the `kubectl` command to verify the status of the cluster nodes: ​

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  kubectl get nodes
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Metrics

Kubernets supports metric aggregates from nodes within the cluster, however this is not setup by default upon cluster initialization. If you wish to utilize the Kubernetes [metrics server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server) you may deploy the latest version using `kubectl`: ​

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
  ```
</CodeGroup>

​ After deployment you may then query the compute utilization of nodes using the `top` command from the CLI:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  kubectl top nodes
  ```
</CodeGroup>

​ Alternatively you can consume node metrics using your own metrics aggregation service poitned to the [metrics API](https://github.com/kubernetes/metrics).

## Configure Kubernetes Secrets

Deepgram strongly recommends following [best practices for configuring Kubernetes Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/). Please refer to [Securing Your Cluster](/docs/securing-your-cluster) for more details.

The `deepgram-self-hosted` Helm chart takes two Secret references. One is a set of distribution credentials that allow the cluster to pull images from Deepgram's container image repository. The other is your self-hosted API key that licenses each Deepgram container that is created.

1. Complete the [Self Service Licensing & Credentials](/docs/self-hosted-self-service-tutorial) guide to generate distribution credentials and a self-hosted API key.

2. If using an external Secret store provider, configure cluster access to these two Secrets, naming them `dg-regcred` (distribution credentials) and `dg-self-hosted-api-key`.

3. If not using an external Secret store provider, create the Secrets manually in your cluster.

   1. Using the distribution credentials username and password generated in the Deepgram Console, create a Kubernetes Secret named `dg-regcred`.

      <CodeGroup>
        ```shell Shell
        kubectl create secret docker-registry dg-regcred \
            --docker-server=quay.io \
            --docker-username=QUAY_DG_USER \
            --docker-password=QUAY_DG_PASSWORD
        ```
      </CodeGroup>

   2. Create a Kubernetes Secret named `dg-self-hosted-api-key` to store your self-hosted API key. /

      <CodeGroup>
        ```shell Shell
        kubectl create secret generic dg-self-hosted-api-key \
            --from-literal=DEEPGRAM_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
        ```
      </CodeGroup>

      <Info>
        Replace the placeholder `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with the Deepgram API key you generated in the [Self Service Licensing & Credentials](/docs/self-hosted-self-service-tutorial) guide.
      </Info>

## Download Models to your K8s Node

​Your Deepgram Account Representative should provide you with download links to at least one voice AI model. Copy the provided model files into a dedicated directory on the host machine.

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  mkdir deepgram-models
  cd deepgram-models
  wget DOWNLOAD_LINK_TO_DEEPGRAM_MODEL
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Create a local `PersistentVolume` in your cluster using [this official Kubernetes guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#local), and set the `spec.local.path` to the absolute path of the `deepgram-models` directory you just created.

## Deploy Deepgram

Deepgram maintains the official `deepgram-self-hosted` Helm Chart. You can reference the [source](https://github.com/deepgram/self-hosted-resources/blob/main/charts/deepgram-self-hosted/README.md) and [Artifact Hub listing](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/deepgram-self-hosted/deepgram-self-hosted) for more details. We'll use this Chart to facilitate deploying Deepgram services in your self-hosted environment.

1. [Fetch the repository info](https://github.com/deepgram/self-hosted-resources/blob/main/charts/deepgram-self-hosted/README.md#get-repository-info).

   <CodeGroup>
     ```shell Shell
     helm repo add deepgram https://deepgram.github.io/self-hosted-resources
     helm repo update
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

2. Download a `values.yaml` template from Deepgram's [self-hosted resources](https://github.com/deepgram/self-hosted-resources/tree/main/charts/deepgram-self-hosted/samples/). For example, [here](https://github.com/deepgram/self-hosted-resources/blob/main/charts/deepgram-self-hosted/samples/03-basic-setup-onprem.yaml) is a template for a basic setup with a self-managed cluster.

3. In your `values.yaml`, modify the `scaling.replicas.{api,engine}` as desired.

4. In your `values.yaml` file, insert the name of your local `PersistentVolume` you created in the previous section.

   <CodeGroup>
     ```yaml yaml
     engine:
       modelManager:
         volumes:
           customVolumeClaim:
             enabled: true
             name: deepgram-models-pv # Replace with the name of the local PersistentVolume you have created
             modelsDirectory: "/"
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

5. Install the Helm Chart with your `values.yaml` file.

   <CodeGroup>
     ```shell Shell
     helm install deepgram deepgram/deepgram-self-hosted \
         -f my-values.yaml \
         --namespace dg-self-hosted \
         --atomic \
         --timeout 1h
     # Monitor the installation in a separate shell
     watch kubectl get all
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   <Warning>
     <h2> Pod Scheduling Failures Limits </h2>
     Resource limits, taints, and other constraints may limit Pod scheduling. If a Pod is not able to be scheduled, you can see its status and a list of associated events with `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`.
   </Warning>

## Test Your Deepgram Setup with a Sample Request

Test your environment and container setup with a local file.

1. Get the name of one of the Deepgram API Pods.
   <CodeGroup>
     ```shell Shell
     API_POD_NAME=$(
         kubectl get pods \
             --selector app=deepgram-api \
             --output jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}' \
             --no-headers
     )
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

2. Launch an ephemeral container to send your test request from.
   <CodeGroup>
     ```shell Shell
     kubectl debug $API_POD_NAME \
         -it \
         --image=curlimages/curl \
         -- /bin/sh
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

3. Inside the ephemeral container, download a sample file from Deepgram (or supply your own file).
   <CodeGroup>
     ```shell Shell
     wget https://dpgr.am/bueller.wav
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

4. Send your audio file to your local Deepgram setup for transcription.

   <CodeGroup>
     ```bash cURL
     curl \
         -X POST \
         --data-binary @bueller.wav \
         "http://deepgram-api-external.dg-self-hosted.svc.cluster.local:8080/v1/listen?model=nova-3&smart_format=true"
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   <Info>
     If needed, adjust pieces of the above command:
     - the query parameters to match the directions from your Deepgram Account Representative
     - the service name `deepgram-api-external`
     - the namespace `dg-self-hosted`
   </Info>

You should receive a JSON response with the transcript and associated metadata. Congratulations - your self-hosted setup is working!

## Next Steps

Your Deepgram services are accessible within your cluster via the `deepgram-api-external` Service that was created by the Helm Chart.
