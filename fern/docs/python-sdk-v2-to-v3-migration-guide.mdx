title: Python SDK V2 to V3 Migration Guide
subtitle: Migrating from Deepgram Python SDK v2 to the Deepgram Python SDK v3
slug: docs/python-sdk-v2-to-v3-migration-guide
---


<Info>
  This guide is for users with experience using the Deepgram Python SDK v2 who want to migrate to the Deepgram Python SDK v3. This is not an end-to-end guide, but a reference for people using our existing Python SDK to migrate to our newest version.
</Info>

# Notable Changes

* Significant Restructure of the Python SDK
* Improved implementation for Live Client
* Implements both Sync(/Threaded) and Async(/Await) Classes and Functions
* Verbosity Logging Levels for Troubleshooting
* WebVTT and SRT captions [published as a standalone package](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-captions)
* Custom Header and Query Parameters for API calls
* Support for future products (APIs)
* Better error handling

# Migration Guide

This migration guide focuses primarily on the Sync/Threaded classes and methods in this SDK. The Async/Await classes and methods are very similar, where the class name will be prepended with "Async" and properties prepended with "async".

For example, the Prerecorded Client for Sync/Threaded would be `Prerecorded` and the Async/Await would be `AsyncPrerecorded`.

If accessing the Pre-recorded Client from the `deepgram.listen` properties, the Sync/Threaded property would be `deepgram.listen.prerecorded` and the Async/Await would be `deepgram.listen.asyncprerecorded`.

## Installation

<CodeGroup>
  ```powershell Terminal
  pip install deepgram-sdk==3.*
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Initialization

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Before
  from deepgram import Deepgram

  # Your Deepgram API Key
  DEEPGRAM_API_KEY = 'YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY'

  # Initialize the Deepgram SDK
  deepgram = Deepgram(DEEPGRAM_API_KEY)
  ```

  ```python After
  from deepgram import DeepgramClient

  # Create a Deepgram client using the DEEPGRAM_API_KEY from environment variables
  deepgram = DeepgramClient()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Transcription: Pre-recorded

We have separated the `callback` feature into its own method. The functionality below is **not** valid with the callback feature.

### Local File Transcription

Transcribe a local file on the same filesystem as the app is running.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Before
  FILE = 'interview_speech-analytics.wav'

  # file is local
  # Open the audio file
  audio = open(FILE, 'rb')

  # Set the source
  source = {
  	'buffer': audio,
  }

  # Send the audio to Deepgram and get the response
  response = await asyncio.create_task(
    deepgram.transcription.prerecorded(
      source,
      {
        'smart_format': "true",
        'summarize': "v2",
      }
    )
  )

  # Write the response to the console
  print(json.dumps(response, indent=4))
  ```

  ```python After
  AUDIO_FILE = "preamble.wav"

  # Call the transcribe_file method on the prerecorded class
    with open(AUDIO_FILE, "rb") as file:
    buffer_data = file.read()

  payload: FileSource = {
  	"buffer": buffer_data,
  }

  options = PrerecordedOptions(
    smart_format=True,
    summarize="v2",
  )
  file_response = deepgram.listen.rest.v("1").transcribe_file(payload, options)

  json = file_response.to_json()
  print(f"{json}")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### URL File Transcription

Transcribe a remote file by sending us a publicly accessible URL to it.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Before
  URL = 'https://static.deepgram.com/examples/interview_speech-analytics.wav'

  # Set the source
  source = {
      'url': URL,
  }

  # Send the audio to Deepgram and get the response
  response = await asyncio.create_task(
    deepgram.transcription.prerecorded(
      source,
      {
        'smart_format': "true",
        'summarize': "v2",
      }
    )
  )

  # Write the response to the console
  print(json.dumps(response, indent=4))
  ```

  ```python After
  AUDIO_URL = {
      "url": "https://static.deepgram.com/examples/Bueller-Life-moves-pretty-fast.wav"
  }

  options = PrerecordedOptions(
      smart_format=True,
      summarize="v2",
  )
  url_response = deepgram.listen.rest.v("1").transcribe_url(AUDIO_URL, options)

  json = url_response.to_json()
  print(f"{json}")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Transcription: Live

The Live Client abstracts the underlying Websocket implementation from the user. This in turn only requires that you deal with higher level functions like `start()`, `write()`, `finish()` methods.

### Live Transcription

Transcribe live audio streams. Previously only Async/Await class and methods were available. As of this release, both Sync/Threaded and Await/Await classes and methods are provided, but the prefered method of performing live transcription is Sync/Threaded.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Before
  try:
    deepgramLive = await deepgram.transcription.live({
      'smart_format': True,
      'interim_results': False,
      'language': 'en-US',
      'model': 'nova-3',
    })
  except Exception as e:
    print(f'Could not open socket: {e}')
    return

  # Listen for the connection to close
  deepgramLive.registerHandler(deepgramLive.event.CLOSE, lambda c: print(
                               f'Connection closed with code {c}.'))

  # Listen for any transcripts received from Deepgram and write them to the console
  deepgramLive.registerHandler(deepgramLive.event.TRANSCRIPT_RECEIVED, print)

  # Listen for the connection to open and send streaming audio from the URL to Deepgram
  # IMPORTANT: This is a blocking call with no way to exit except through a Cntl-C,
  # IMPORTANT: disconnecting your internet, or killing the streaming (assuming you control that)
  async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
    async with session.get(URL) as audio:
    while True:
      data = await audio.content.readany()
      deepgramLive.send(data)

  # If no data is being sent from the live stream, then break out of the loop.
  if not data:
  	break

  # Indicate that we've finished sending data by sending the customary zero-byte message to the Deepgram streaming endpoint, and wait until we get back the final summary metadata object
  await deepgramLive.finish()
  ```

  ```python After
  try:
      deepgram: DeepgramClient = DeepgramClient()

      dg_connection = deepgram.listen.websocket.v("1")

  		# define callbacks for transcription messages
      def on_message(self, result, **kwargs):
          sentence = result.channel.alternatives[0].transcript
          if len(sentence) == 0:
              return
          print(f"speaker: {sentence}")

      dg_connection.on(LiveTranscriptionEvents.Transcript, on_message)

      # connect to websocket
      options = LiveOptions(model="nova-3", interim_results=False, language="en-US")
      dg_connection.start(options)

      lock_exit = threading.Lock()
      exit = False

      # define a worker thread
      def myThread():
        with httpx.stream("GET", URL) as r:
          for data in r.iter_bytes():
            lock_exit.acquire()
            if exit:
              	break
            lock_exit.release()

            dg_connection.send(data)

      # start the worker thread
      myHttp = threading.Thread(target=myThread)
      myHttp.start()

      # signal finished
      input("Press Enter to stop recording...\n\n")
      lock_exit.acquire()
      exit = True
      lock_exit.release()

      # Wait for the HTTP thread to close and join
      myHttp.join()

      # Indicate that we've finished
      dg_connection.finish()

  except Exception as e:
      print(f"Could not open socket: {e}")
      return
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Self-Hosted API

**\[NOTICE]** The self-hosted API has not changed since the last release, but in `v4` these APIs will likely go through a breaking change. There was only so much we could do with this release and unfortunately, these APIs failed to make the cut off.
