<Info>
  When the LLM decides to call a function, it sends a message to the client indicating the need to invoke a specific functionâ€”this message is called a [FunctionCallRequest.](/docs/voice-agent-server-messages#functioncallrequest) In response, the client processes the request, calls the desired function, and then sends back the result as a FunctionCallResponse.
</Info>

# What is the `FunctionCallResponse` Message

The`FunctionCallResponse` message is a JSON command that the client should reply with every time there is a `FunctionCallRequest` received.

## Sending `FunctionCallResponse`

To send the `FunctionCallResponse` message, you need to send the following JSON message to the server:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
    "type": "FunctionCallResponse",
    "function_call_id": "", // The same ID received in the request
    "output": "" // A string containing the result of the function call
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## `FunctionCallResponse` Confirmation

There is no confirmation message sent to the client after it sends a `FunctionCallResponse` to the server. You know your function call was processed successfully if the conversation proceeds and the agent replies

# Conclusion

the `FunctionCallResponse` message serves as a standardized JSON command that the client must send in direct response to each FunctionCallRequest received. This ensures consistent communication, facilitates prompt data exchange, and maintains a reliable workflow between the client and server.
