# What is the `FunctionCallResponse` Message

The `FunctionCallResponse` message contains the result of a function execution. When you receive a `FunctionCallRequest`, you must respond with a `FunctionCallResponse` containing the function's output.

## Sending `FunctionCallResponse`

Here's an example of a `FunctionCallResponse` message:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
    "type": "FunctionCallResponse",
    "id": "fc_12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef",
    "name": "check_order_status",
    "content": "Order #123456 status: Shipped - Expected delivery date: 2024-03-15"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## `FunctionCallResponse` Confirmation

There is no confirmation message sent to the client after it sends a `FunctionCallResponse` to the server. You know your function call was processed successfully if the conversation proceeds and the agent replies.

# Conclusion

Each `FunctionCallRequest` should be answered with a `FunctionCallResponse`. The response provides the function's result back to the voice agent, allowing it to continue the conversation with the updated information.
