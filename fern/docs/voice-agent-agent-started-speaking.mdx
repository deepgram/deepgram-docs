# What is the `AgentStartedSpeaking` Message

The `AgentStartedSpeaking` message will signal the client that the agent has begun streaming audio.

## Receiving `AgentStartedSpeaking`

The server will send an `AgentStartedSpeaking` message when it begins streaming an agent audio response to the client for playback.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
    "type": "AgentStartedSpeaking",
    "total_latency": 0.0, // Seconds from receiving the user's utterance to producing the agent's reply
    "tts_latency": 0.0, // The portion of total latency attributable to text-to-speech
    "ttt_latency": 0.0 // The portion of total latency attributable to text-to-text (usually an LLM)
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Conclusion

The `AgentStartedSpeaking` message notifies the client when the server begins streaming an agent's audio response for playback. This message includes key latency metrics, such as total latency, text-to-speech latency, and text-to-text latency, providing valuable insights into the response generation process. These details help developers monitor and optimize system performance, ensuring a smoother and more responsive user experience.
