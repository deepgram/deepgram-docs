This guide will walk you through how to turn text into speech with Deepgram's text-to-speech REST API.

<Info>
  Before you start, you'll need to follow the steps in the [Make Your First API Request](/docs/make-your-first-api-request) guide to obtain a Deepgram API key, and configure your environment if you are choosing to use a Deepgram SDK.
</Info>

## API Playground

First, quickly explore Deepgram Text to Speech in our API Playground.

<div class="api-playground-call">
<span>
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/deepgram/image/upload/v1717523786/devex/codey-greeting_rekqe1.svg" alt="Deepgram API Playground"/>   Try this feature out in our [API Playground](https://playground.deepgram.com/?endpoint=speak)!
</span>
</div>

## CURL

Next, try it with CURL. Add your own API key where it says `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` and then run the following example in a terminal or your favorite API client.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl --request POST \
       --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
       --header "Authorization: Token DEEPGRAM_API_KEY" \
       --output your_output_file.mp3 \
       --data '{"text":"Hello, how can I help you today?"}' \
       --url "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/speak?model=aura-asteria-en"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This will result in an MP3 audio file being streamed back to you by Deepgram. You can play the audio as soon as you receive the first byte, or you can wait until the entire MP3 file has arrived.

The audio file will contain the voice of the selected model saying the words that you sent in your request.

<Info>
  If you do not specify a `model`, the default voice model `aura-asteria-en` will be used. You can find all of our available voices [here](/docs/tts-models).
</Info>

### Send Error Messages to Terminal

If your request results in an error, the error message can be seen by opening the output audio file in a text editor.

To see the error message in your terminal, add this to your CURL request:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  --fail-with-body \
  --silent \
  || (jq . your_output_file.mp3 && rm your_output_file.mp3)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This example will capture the error message using `jq` and remove the output file (tts.mp3) automatically.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl --request POST \
       --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
       --header "Authorization: Token DEEPGRAM_API_KEY" \
       --output your_output_file.mp3 \
       --data '{"text":"Hello, how can I help you today?"}' \
       --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/speak?model=testing_error' \
       --fail-with-body \
       --silent \
       || (jq . your_output_file.mp3 && rm your_output_file.mp3)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## SDKs

Deepgram has several SDKs that can make it easier to use the API. Follow these steps to use the SDK of your choice to make a Deepgram TTS request.

  ```shell C#
  # Importing the Deepgram Go SDK should pull in all dependencies required
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Make the Request with the SDK

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript JavaScript
  const { createClient } = require("@deepgram/sdk");
  const fs = require("fs");

  // STEP 1: Create a Deepgram client with your API key
  const deepgram = createClient(process.env.DEEPGRAM_API_KEY);

  const text = "Hello, how can I help you today?";

  const getAudio = async () => {
    // STEP 2: Make a request and configure the request with options (such as model choice, audio configuration, etc.)
    const response = await deepgram.speak.request(
      { text },
      {
        model: "aura-asteria-en",
        encoding: "linear16",
        container: "wav",
      }
    );
    // STEP 3: Get the audio stream and headers from the response
    const stream = await response.getStream();
    const headers = await response.getHeaders();
    if (stream) {
      // STEP 4: Convert the stream to an audio buffer
      const buffer = await getAudioBuffer(stream);
      // STEP 5: Write the audio buffer to a file
      fs.writeFile("output.wav", buffer, (err) => {
        if (err) {
          console.error("Error writing audio to file:", err);
        } else {
          console.log("Audio file written to output.wav");
        }
      });
    } else {
      console.error("Error generating audio:", stream);
    }

    if (headers) {
      console.log("Headers:", headers);
    }
  };

  // helper function to convert stream to audio buffer
  const getAudioBuffer = async (response) => {
    const reader = response.getReader();
    const chunks = [];

    while (true) {
      const { done, value } = await reader.read();
      if (done) break;

      chunks.push(value);
    }

    const dataArray = chunks.reduce(
      (acc, chunk) => Uint8Array.from([...acc, ...chunk]),
      new Uint8Array(0)
    );

    return Buffer.from(dataArray.buffer);
  };

  getAudio();
  ```

  ```python Python
  import os
  import logging
  from deepgram.utils import verboselogs

  from deepgram import (
      DeepgramClient,
      SpeakOptions,
  )

  SPEAK_TEXT = {"text": "Hello world!"}
  filename = "test.mp3"

  def main():
      try:
          # STEP 1 Create a Deepgram client using the API key from environment variables
          deepgram = DeepgramClient()

          # STEP 2 Call the save method on the speak property
          options = SpeakOptions(
              model="aura-asteria-en",
          )

          response = deepgram.speak.rest.v("1").save(filename, SPEAK_TEXT, options)
          print(response.to_json(indent=4))

      except Exception as e:
          print(f"Exception: {e}")

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()
  ```

  	options := interfaces.SpeakOptions{
  		Model:     "aura-asteria-en",
  		Encoding:  "linear16",
  		Container: "wav",
  	}

  	// STEP 4: create a Deepgram client using default settings
  	// NOTE: you can set your API KEY in your bash profile by typing the following line in your shell:
  	// export DEEPGRAM_API_KEY = "YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY"
  	c := client.NewWithDefaults()
  	dg := speak.New(c)

  	// STEP 5: send/process file to Deepgram
  	res, err := dg.ToSave(ctx, filePath, textToSpeech, options)
  	if err != nil {
  		fmt.Printf("FromStream failed. Err: %v\n", err)
  		os.Exit(1)
  	}

  	// STEP 6: get the JSON response
  	data, err := json.Marshal(res)
  	if err != nil {
  		fmt.Printf("json.Marshal failed. Err: %v\n", err)
  		os.Exit(1)

<Info>
  To learn more about how you can customize the audio file to meet the needs of your use case, take a look at this [Audio Format Combinations](/docs/tts-media-output-settings#audio-format-combinations) table.
</Info>

## Non-SDK Code Examples

If you would like to try out making a Deepgram speech-to-text request in a specific language (but not using Deepgram's SDKs), we offer a library of code-samples in this [Github repo](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/code-samples). However, we recommend first trying out our SDKs, which we presented in the previous section.

## Results

Upon successful processing of the request, you will receive an audio file containing the synthesized text-to-speech output, along with response headers providing additional information.

<Info>
  The audio file is streamed back to you, so you may begin playback as soon as the first byte arrives. Read the guide [Streaming Audio Outputs](/docs/streaming-the-audio-output) to learn how to begin playing the stream immediately versus waiting for the entire file to arrive.
</Info>

### Example Response Headers

<CodeGroup>
  ```text http
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  < content-type: audio/mpeg
  < dg-model-name: aura-asteria-en
  < dg-model-uuid: e4979ab0-8475-4901-9d66-0a562a4949bb
  < dg-char-count: 32
  < dg-request-id: bf6fc5c7-8f84-479f-b70a-602cf5bf18f3
  < transfer-encoding: chunked
  < date: Thu, 29 Feb 2024 19:20:48 GMT
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  To see these response headers when making a CURL request, add `-v` or `--verbose` to your request.
</Info>

This includes:

* `content-type`: Specifies the media type of the resource, in this case, `audio/mpeg`, indicating the format of the audio file returned.
* `dg-request-id`: A unique identifier for the request, useful for debugging and tracking purposes.
* `dg-model-uuid`: The unique identifier of the model that processed the request.
* `dg-char-count`: Indicates the number of characters that were in the input text for the text-to-speech process.
* `dg-model-name`: The name of the model used to process the request.
* `transfer-encoding`: Specifies the form of encoding used to safely transfer the payload to the recipient.
* `date`: The date and time the response was sent.

## Limits

Keep these limits in mind when making a Deepgram text-to-speech request.

### Input Text Limit

* Maximum characters: **2000**.
* Sending a text payload longer than 2000 characters (2001 or more) will result in an error, and the audio file will not be created.

### Rate Limits

* **Pay As You Go Plan**: 480 requests per minute.
* **Growth Plan**: 720 requests per minute.

<Info>
  The current rate limit per project is 480 requests per minute for Pay As You Go and 720 requests per minute for Growth plans. Learn more at Deepgram's [pricing page](https://deepgram.com/pricing) or [share your feedback on our TTS rate limits](https://deepgram.typeform.com/tts-rate-limit).
</Info>

#### Handling Rate Limits

* If the number of in-progress requests for a project meets or exceeds the rate limit, new requests will receive a **429: Too Many Requests** error.
* With a typical response time of 250ms, users of our Pay As You Go or Growth plans can achieve a request rate of roughly:\
  `2 (concurrent requests) / 0.250 (250 ms response time) * 60 (seconds/minute) = 480 requests per minute.`
