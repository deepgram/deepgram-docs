# Using other audio formats

We recommend testing small sets of audio when first operating with new audio sources to ensure compatibility.

Because audio format is largely unconstrained, we always recommend to ensure compatibility by testing small sets of audio when first operating with new audio sources.

# Audio format best practices

Generally you don't have to specify the audio format in your API request but if you know the format of your audio, providing it in you API request can help reduce unnecessary computation.
