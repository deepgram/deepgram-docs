The [Deepgram's Streaming API](/reference/listen-live) unlocks many use cases ranging from captioning to notetaking and much more. If you aren't able to use our Deepgram SDKs for your Streaming needs, this guide will provide a Reference Implementation for you.

<Info>
  Most users will not need this Reference Implementation because Deepgram provides [SDKs](/docs/deepgram-sdks) that already implement the Streaming API. This is an **optional** guide to help individuals interested in building and maintaining their own SDK specific to the Deepgram Streaming API.
</Info>

For additional reference see our Deepgram SDKs which include the Websocket-based Streaming API:

* [Javascript SDK](/docs/node-sdk)
* [Python SDK](/docs/python-sdk)
* [.NET SDK](/docs/dotnet-sdk)
* [Go SDK](/docs/go-sdk)

## Using a Deepgram SDK vs Building Your Own SDK

The Deepgram SDKs should address most needs; however, if you find limitations or issues in any of the above SDKs, we encourage you to report issues, bugs, or ideas for new features in the open source repositories. Our SDK projects are open to code contributions as well.

If you still need to implement your own SDK, this guide will enable you to do that.

## Prerequisites

It is highly recommended that you familiarize yourself with the WebSocket protocol defined by [RFC-6455](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455). If you are still getting familiar with what an [IETF RFC](https://www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs/) is, they are very detailed specifications on how something works and behaves. In this case, [RFC-6455](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455) describes how to implement WebSockets. You will need to understand this document to understand how to interact with the Deepgram Streaming API.

Once you understand the WebSocket protocol, it's recommended to understand the capabilities of your WebSocket protocol library available in the language you chose to implement your SDK in.

Refer to the language specific implementations for [RFC-6455](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455) (i.e. the WebSocket protocol):

* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket)
* [Python](https://github.com/python-websockets/websockets)
* [GOrilla](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket) or [Go Networking](https://cs.opensource.google/go/x/net)
* [C# .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/websockets?view=aspnetcore-8.0)

These are just some of the available implementations in those languages. They are just the ones that are very popular in those language-specific communities.

Additionally, you will need to understand applications that are [multi-threaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading_\(computer_architecture\)), [access the internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network_programming), and do so [securely via TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer). These are going to be essential components to building your SDK.

## Deepgram Streaming API

The goal of your SDK should minimally be:

* **Manage the Connection Lifecycle**: Implement robust connection management to handle opening, error handling, message sending, receiving, and closing of the WebSocket connection.
* **Concurrency and Threading**: Depending on the SDK's target language, manage concurrency appropriately to handle the asynchronous nature of WebSocket communication without blocking the main thread.
* **Error Handling and Reconnection**: Implement error handling and automatic reconnection logic. Transient network issues should not result in lost data or service interruptions.
* **Implement KeepAlives**: Deepgram's API may require keepalive messages to maintain the connection. Implement a mechanism to send periodic pings or other suitable messages to prevent timeouts.

## High-Level Pseudo-Code for Deepgram Streaming API

It's essential that you encapsulate your WebSocket connection in a class or similar representation. This will reduce undesired, highly coupled WebSocket code with your application's code. In the industry, this has often been referred to as minimizing ["Spaghetti code"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code). If you have WebSocket code or you need to import the above WebSocket libraries into your `func main()`, this is undesirable unless your application is trivially small.

To implement the WebSocket Client correctly, you must implement based on the WebSocket protocol defined in [RFC-6455](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455). Please refer to section [4.1 Client Requirements](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455#section-4.1) in RFC-6455.

You want first to declare a WebSocket class of some sort specific to your implementation language:

<CodeGroup>
  ```text Text
  // This class could simply be called WebSocketClient
  // However, since this is specifically for Deepgram, it could be called DeepgramClient
  class WebSocketClient {
    private url: String
    private apiKey: String
    private websocket: WebSocket
    
    // other class properties
    
    // other class methods
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**NOTE:** Depending on the programming language of choice, you might either need to implement `async`/`await` and `threaded` classes to support both threading models. These concepts occur in languages like Javascript, Python, and others. You can implement one or both based on your user's needs.

You will then need to implement the following class methods.

### Function: Connect

```
class WebSocketClient {
  ...
  function Connect() {
    // Implement the websocket connection here 
  }
  ...
}
```

This function should:

* Initialize the WebSocket connection using the `URL` and `API Key`.
* Set up event listener threads for connection events (message, metadata, error).
* Start the keep alive timer based on the `Keepalive Interval`.

### Thread: Receive and Process Messages

```
class WebSocketClient {
  ...
  function ThreadProcessMessages() {
    // Implement the thread handler to process messages
  }
  ...
}
```

This thread should:

* When a message arrives, check if it's a transcription result or a system message.
* For transcription messages, process or handle the transcription data.
* Handle system messages accordingly (may include error messages or status updates).

### Function: Send

```
class WebSocketClient {
  ...
  function SendBinary([]bytes) {
    // Implements a send function to transport audio to the Deepgram server
  }

  function SendMessage([]byte) {
    // Implements a send function to transport control messages to the Deepgram server 
  }
  ...
}
```

The `SendBinary()` function should:

* Accept audio data as input.
* Send the audio data over the WebSocket connection to Deepgram for processing.

The `SendMessage()` function should:

* Accept JSON data as input.
* Send the JSON over the WebSocket connection to Deepgram for handling control or connection management type functions. A `KeepAlive` or `CloseStream` messages are examples of these types of messages.

If you need more information on the difference, please refer to [RFC-6455](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455).

### (Optional) Thread: KeepAlive

```
class WebSocketClient {
  ...
  function ThreadKeepAlive() {
    // Implement the thread handler to process messages
  }
  ...
}
```

This thread is optional providing that audio data is constantly streaming to through the WebSocket; otherwise, it should:

* Regularly send a keepalive message (such as a ping) to Deepgram based on the `Keepalive Interval` to maintain the connection.

Notice this thread is independent of the Receive/Process Message Thread above.

### Function: Close

```
class WebSocketClient {
  ...
  function Close() {
    // Implement shutting down the websocket
  }
  ...
}
```

This function should:

* Send a command to close the WebSocket connection.
* Stop the keepalive timer to clean up resources.

## Deepgram API Specifics

Now that you have a basic client, you must handle the Deepgram API specifics. Refer to this documentation for[ more information](/reference/listen-live) .

### Function: Connect

When establishing a connection, you must pass the required parameters defined by the [Deepgram Query Parameters](/reference/listen-live#query-params).

### Thread: Receive and Process Messages

If successfully connected, you should start receiving transcription messages (albeit empty) in the [Response Schema](/reference/listen-live#response-schema) defined below.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
    "metadata": {
      "transaction_key": "string",
      "request_id": "uuid",
      "sha256": "string",
      "created": "string",
      "duration": 0,
      "channels": 0,
      "models": [
        "string"
      ],
    },
    "type": "Results",
    "channel_index": [
      0,
      0
    ],
    "duration": 0.0,
    "start": 0.0,
    "is_final": boolean,
    "speech_final": boolean,
    "channel": {
      "alternatives": [
        {
          "transcript": "string",
          "confidence": 0,
          "words": [
            {
              "word": "string",
              "start": 0,
              "end": 0,
              "confidence": 0
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "search": [
        {
          "query": "string",
          "hits": [
            {
              "confidence": 0,
              "start": 0,
              "end": 0,
              "snippet": "string"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

For convenience, you will need to marshal these JSON representations into usable objects/classes to give your users an easier time using your SDK.

### (Optional) Thread: KeepAlive

If you do implement the KeepAlive message, you will need to follow the [guidelines defined here.](/reference/listen-live#stream-keepalive)

### Function: Close

When you are ready to close your WebSocket client, you will need to follow the shutdown [guidelines defined here.](/reference/listen-live#close-stream)

### Special Considerations: Errors

You must be able to handle any protocol-level defined in [RFC-6455](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455) and application-level (i.e., messages from Deepgram) you will need to follow the [guidelines defined here.](/reference/listen-live#error-handling)

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common implementation mistakes.

### My WebSocket Connection Immediately Disconnects

There are usually a few reasons why the Deepgram Platform will terminate the connection:

* No audio data is making it through the WebSocket to the Deepgram Platform. The platform will terminate the connection if no audio data is received in roughly 10 seconds.
* A variation on the above... you have muted the audio source and are no longer sending an audio stream or data.
* The audio encoding is not supported OR the [`encoding`](/docs/encoding) parameter does not match the encoding in the audio stream.
* Invalid connection options via the query parameters are being used. This could be things like misspelling an option or using an incorrect value.

### My WebSocket Connection Disconnects in the Middle of My Conversation

There are usually a few reasons why the Deepgram Platform will terminate the connection (similar to the above):

* You have muted the audio source and are no longer sending an audio stream or data.
* If no audio data is being sent, you must implement the [KeepAlive](/reference/listen-live#stream-keepalive) protocol message.

### My Transcription Messages Are Getting Delayed

There are usually a few reasons why the Deepgram Platform delays sending transcription messages:

* You inadvertently send the [KeepAlive](/reference/listen-live#stream-keepalive) protocol message as a Data or Stream message. This will cause the audio processing to choke or hiccup, thus causing the delay. Please refer to [RFC-6455](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455) to learn more about the difference between data and control messages.
* Network connectivity issues. Please ensure your connection to the Deepgram domain/IP is good. Use `ping` and `traceroute` or `tracert` to map the network path from source to destination.

## Additional Considerations

By adopting object-oriented programming (OOP), the pseudo-code above provides a clear structure for implementing the SDK across different programming languages that support OOP paradigms. This structure facilitates better abstraction, encapsulation, and modularity, making the SDK more adaptable to future changes in the Deepgram API or the underlying WebSocket protocol.

As you implement and refine your SDK, remember that the essence of good software design lies in solving the problem at hand and crafting a solution that's maintainable, extensible, and easy to use.
