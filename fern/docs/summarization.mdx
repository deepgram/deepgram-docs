Deepgram’s Summarization feature summarizes the content of the submitted audio and returns a brief summary in the JSON response.

## Enable Feature

To enable Summarization V2, use the following parameter in the query string when you call Deepgram’s `/listen` endpoint :

`summarize=v2`

To transcribe audio from a file on your computer, run the following curl command in a terminal or your favorite API client.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl \
    --request POST \
    --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
    --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \
    --data-binary @youraudio.wav \
    --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?summarize=v2'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your [Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys).
</Warning>

### Query Parameters

| Parameter   | Value   | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------- | ------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `summarize` | `v2`    | string  | Enables the `V2` version of summarization. The output response will include a single object with a result and short summary of the entire audio. It will generate one summary across all channels.                                              |
| `summarize` | `true`  | boolean | Enables the `V1` version of summarization. The output response will include an array of objects with `summary`, `start_word`, and `end_word`. It will generate summaries per channel. Summarization V1 is deprecated. |
| `summarize` | `false` | boolean | Disables the summarization feature.                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Analyze Response

When the file is finished processing, you’ll receive a JSON response that has the following basic structure:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
    "metadata": {...},
    "results": {
          "channels": [
              {
                  "alternatives": [...]
              }
          ],
          "summary": {
              "result":"success"
              "short": "Jake calls the Honda dealership and speaks with Josh about the new Honda Civic 2023. Jake schedules a test drive for the hybrid model on Friday and provides his contact information.Josh confirms the appointment and tells Jake to call if he has any further questions."
          }
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The `summary` object contains:

* `result`: Status of the request (success | failure).
* `short`: Short summary of the audio being summarized.

This summarization feature produces one summary across all channels so that the `summary` field ranks at the same place in the JSON response as the `channels` array.

<Warning>
  The JSON response for Summarization `V2` (`summarize=v2`) differs from the JSON response for Summarization `V1` (`summarize=true`).
</Warning>

### API Error and Warning Response

#### Error

If you request Summarization V2 with an unsupported language by specifying a language code such as `summarize=v2&language=es`, you will get an error message like the one below.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
      "err_code": "Bad Request",
      "err_msg": "Summarization v2 not supported for non-English languages",
      "request_id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Warning

If you request Summarization V2 with automatic language detection such as `summarize=v2&detect_language=true`, where the detected language is unsupported (Spanish, for example), you will get the response, including a transcript and a warning object.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  "warnings": [
      {
        "parameter": "TEXT",
        "type": "unsupported_language",
        "message": "TEXT"
      }
  ]
  ```
</CodeGroup>

| Warning Name           | Warning Message                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `unsupported_language` | Feature isn't supported with the specified or detected language. |

**Example Warning**

Here is an example of the JSON structure of a request with warning object:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
   "metadata": {
  ...
         },
         "warnings": [
             {
              "parameter": "summarize",
              "type": "unsupported_language",
              "message": "Summarization isn’t supported for the detected language."
             }
         ],
     },
   "results": {
         "channels": [
              {
                  "alternatives": [...]
              }
          ],
          "summary":
            {
              "result": "failure",
              "short": "The summarization feature is currently only available in English. Please check out our API documentation for more details."
        }
      }
  }
  ```
