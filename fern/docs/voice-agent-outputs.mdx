Server Events are messages sent from the Deepgram server to the client over the WebSocket connection during a voice agent interaction. These events provide real-time updates about the conversation's status, including user and agent actions, as well as any processing that's occurring.

## List of Server Events

* `Welcome`: Confirms that the WebSocket has opened successfully.
* `Settings Applied`: Confirms that the configuration settings have been applied.
* `Conversation Text`: Provides the text of what was spoken by either the user or the agent.
* `User Started Speaking`: Notifies that the user has begun speaking.
* `Agent Thinking`: Informs the client that the agent is processing information.
* `Function Call Request`: Sent when the agent needs to make a function call.
* `Function Calling Message`: Provides information about a function being called.
* `Agent Started Speaking`: Signals that the server has begun streaming the agent's audio response.
* `Agent Audio Done`: Indicates that the server has finished sending the final audio segment to the client.
* `Agent Server Errors`: Notifies the client if an error has occurred on the server side.

Each of these events serves a specific purpose in managing the flow of the conversation and keeping the client informed about the state of the interaction. They allow for a dynamic and responsive experience when using Deepgram's Voice Agent API.

For more detailed information on each of these events, read each individual Server Event documentation page.
