subtitle: >-
  Prometheus is a powerful monitoring and alerting toolkit, often used for
  collecting and querying various system metrics. This guide outlines the steps
  required to integrate Prometheus with an self-hosted instance.

## Kubernetes

Deepgram supports self-hosted deployments on [Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes) via the [`deepgram-self-hosted` Helm chart](https://github.com/deepgram/self-hosted-resources/tree/main/charts/deepgram-self-hosted). Prometheus will be installed and automatically configured if either `scaling.auto.enabled` or `kube-prometheus-stack.includeDependency` is set to true.

If you would like to add additional configuration, see the [`kube-prometheus-stack` Helm chart](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack) for available values. See the [Overriding Values from a Parent Chart](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/subcharts_and_globals/#overriding-values-from-a-parent-chart) documentation for details on setting these values in the `kube-prometheus-stack` subchart from the `deepgram-self-hosted` parent chart.

## Docker/Podman

Self-hosted deployments utilizing [Docker or Podman](/docs/dockerpodman) will need to manually install and manage Prometheus.

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you have the following:

* Access to the self-hosted instance with the metrics endpoint exposed. See the [Metrics Guide](/docs/metrics-guide) for details. Note that this guide assumes you chose port 9991 for the `HOST_PORT`.
* Prometheus installed on your machine or server. Visit [Download Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/download/) for installation instructions.
* Local system permissions to modify the Prometheus configuration file (usually named `prometheus.yml`)

### Integrate with Deepgram Engine

#### Step 1: Add Prometheus Target

Add the target to the Prometheus configuration file in the `prometheus.yml` file. Locate the `scrape_configs` section, and add a new job with the Engine container instance as a target:

<CodeGroup>
  ```yaml yaml
  scrape_configs:
    - job_name: "dg_self_hosted_instance"
      static_configs:
        - targets: ["<ENGINE_INSTANCE_URI>:9991"]
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Replace `<ENGINE_INSTANCE_URI>` with the IP address or hostname of the Engine container. Save the configuration file.

#### Step 2: Reload Prometheus Configuration

To apply the changes made to the `prometheus.yml` file, you need to reload the Prometheus configuration. You can do this by restarting the Prometheus service:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  sudo systemctl restart prometheus
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Step 3: Verify the Integration

Open the Prometheus web interface, usually accessible at `http://localhost:9090`, and navigate to the "Targets" page (under the "Status" menu). You should see the `dg_self_hosted_instance` job listed with a status of "UP", indicating that Prometheus is successfully scraping metrics from the Engine container.

### Querying Metrics

With the integration complete, you can now query the collected metrics using the Prometheus web interface or API. You may consider using a tool like [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for handling visualization and alerting.
