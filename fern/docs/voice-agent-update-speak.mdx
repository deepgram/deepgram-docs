# What is the `UpdateSpeak` Message

The`UpdateSpeak` message is a JSON command that you can use to change the Speak model in the middle of a conversation.

## Sending `UpdateSpeak`

To send the `UpdateSpeak` message, you need to send the following JSON message to the server:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
    "type": "UpdateSpeak",
    "model": "" // The new Speak model  
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## `UpdateSpeak` Confirmation

Upon receiving the `UpdateSpeak` message, the server will process all remaining audio data and return the following:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
      "type": "SpeakUpdated"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

# Conclusion

the `UpdateSpeak` message is a powerful JSON command that allows you to switch the Speak model during a conversation. This flexibility enables real-time adjustments to the agent's voice output, ensuring a more dynamic and responsive interaction tailored to the evolving needs of the conversation.
