The `UpdateSpeak` message is a JSON message that you can use to change the Speak model in the middle of a conversation.

## Purpose
The `UpdateSpeak` message is a JSON message that allows you to switch the Speak model during a conversation. This flexibility enables real-time adjustments to the agent's voice output, ensuring a more dynamic and responsive interaction tailored to the evolving needs of the conversation.

## Example Payloads

To send the `UpdateSpeak` message, you need to send the following JSON message to the server:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
    "type": "UpdateSpeak",
    "model": "" // The new Speak model
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Upon receiving the `UpdateSpeak` message, the server will process all remaining audio data and return a [`SpeakUpdated`](/docs/voice-agent-speak-updated) message.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
      "type": "SpeakUpdated"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>
