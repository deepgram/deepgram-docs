The Deepgram [`Pre-Recorded Clients`](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/tree/main/deepgram/clients/listen/v1/rest) allows you to request transcripts for pre-recorded audio. To request a transcript for a pre-recorded particular audio file, you'll use one of the following functions depending on your audio source:

* [`transcribe_file`](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/blob/main/deepgram/clients/listen/v1/rest/client.py#L187)
* [`transcribe_url`](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/blob/main/deepgram/clients/listen/v1/rest/client.py#L41)

<Info>
  This SDK supports both the Threaded and Async/Await Clients as described in the [Threaded and Async IO Task Support](/docs/threaded-and-async-io-task-support) section. The code blocks contain a tab for `Threaded` and `Async` to show examples for `prerecorded` versus `asyncprerecorded`, respectively. The difference between `Threaded` and `Async` is subtle.

## Pre-recorded Transcription Parameters

| Parameter | Type        | Description                                |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| source    | Buffer, Url | Provides the source of audio to transcribe |
| options   | Object      | Parameters to filter requests. See below.  |

You can pass a Buffer or URL to a file to transcribe. Here's how to construct each:

### Sending a URL

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  source = {'url': URL_TO_AUDIO_FILE}
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Sending a Buffer

Open a file and send the buffer returned.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Threaded
  with open(PATH_TO_FILE, 'rb') as audio:
    source = {'buffer': audio}
  ```

  ```python Async
  async with aiofiles.open(filename, "rb") as audio:
  	source = {'buffer': audio}
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Pre-recorded Transcription Options

Additional transcription options can be provided for pre-recorded transcriptions. They are provided as an object as the second parameter of the `transcription.prerecorded` function. Each of these parameters maps to a feature in the Deepgram API. Reference the [features documentation](/docs/features-overview) to learn the appropriate features for your request.

## Pre-recorded Transcription Example Request

With the source you chose above, call the transcription function and provide any additional options as an object.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Threaded
  try:
      # STEP 1 Create a Deepgram client using the DEEPGRAM_API_KEY from environment variables
      deepgram = DeepgramClient()

      # STEP 2 Call the transcribe_url method on the prerecorded class
      options = PrerecordedOptions(
          model="nova-3",
          smart_format=True,
          summarize="v2",
      )
      url_response = deepgram.listen.rest.v("1").transcribe_url(
          AUDIO_URL, options
      )
      print(url_response)

  except Exception as e:
      print(f"Exception: {e}")
  ```

  ```python Async
  try:
      # STEP 1 Create a Deepgram client using the DEEPGRAM_API_KEY from environment variables
      deepgram = DeepgramClient()

      # STEP 2 Call the transcribe_url method on the prerecorded class
      options = PrerecordedOptions(
          model="nova-3",
          smart_format=True,
          summarize="v2",
      )
      url_response = await deepgram.listen.asyncrest.v("1").transcribe_url(
          AUDIO_URL, options
      )
      print(url_response)

  except Exception as e:
      print(f"Exception: {e}")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Increasing the Timeout for Processing Larger Files

You might need to increase the default HTTP Timeout setting for larger files. The example increases the time to 300 seconds (or 5 mins).

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Threaded
  # this will increase the timeout to 300 seconds or 5 minutes
  response = deepgram.listen.rest.v("1").transcribe_file(
    payload, options, timeout=httpx.Timeout(300.0, connect=10.0)
  )
  ```

  ```python Async
  # this will increase the timeout to 300 seconds or 5 minutes
  response = await deepgram.listen.asyncrest.v("1").transcribe_file(
    payload, options, timeout=httpx.Timeout(300.0, connect=10.0)
  )
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Where To Find Additional Examples

The SDK repository has a good collection of live audio transcription examples. The [README](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#examples) contains links to them. Each example below attempts to provide different options for transcribing an audio source.

Some Examples

* Threaded Client using an Audio File - [examples/speech-to-text/rest/file](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/blob/main/examples/speech-to-text/rest/file/main.py)
* Threaded Client from a URL - [examples/speech-to-text/rest/url](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/blob/main/examples/speech-to-text/rest/url/main.py)

If the Async Client suits your use case better:

* Async Client from a URL - [examples/speech-to-text/rest/async\_url](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/blob/main/examples/speech-to-text/rest/async_url/main.py)
