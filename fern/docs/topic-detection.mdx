Deepgram’s Topic Detection feature identifies key topics within the transcript, returning a list of text segments and the topics found within each segment.

The list of topics that can be identified is not a fixed list; this TSLM powered feature is able to generate topics based on the context of the language content in the transcript. You may also choose to use the optional `custom-topic` parameter to provide a custom topic you want detected if present within your audio.

## Enable Feature

To enable Topic Detection, use the following parameter in the query string when you call Deepgram’s `/listen` endpoint:

`topics=true`

To transcribe audio from a file on your computer, run the following curl command in a terminal or your favorite API client.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl \
    --request POST \
    --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
    --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \
    --data-binary @youraudio.wav \
    --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?topics=true'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your [Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys).

## Analyze Response

When the file is finished processing, you’ll receive a JSON response that has the following basic structure:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
    "metadata": {...},
    "results": {
      "channels": [
        {
          "alternatives": [...]
        }
      ],
      "topics": {
        "segments": [
          {
            "text": "Can I upgrade my phone?",
            "start_word": 13,
            "end_word": 17,
            "topics": [
              { "topic": "Phone upgrade", "confidence_score": 0.9661531 }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The response object values for `topics` are:

* `segments`: The list of segments of text identified by the model as containing notable topics.
* `topic`: The name of the topic detected by the model.
* `confidence_score`: a floating point from 0 to 1 representing the models confidence in this prediction.

### API Warning Response

#### Warning

If you request Topic Detection with an unsupported language by specifying a language code such as `topics=true&language=es` or `topics=true&detect_language=true` where the detected language is unsupported, you will get the warning message below.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  "warnings": [
    {
      "parameter": "topics",
      "type": "unsupported_language",
      "message": "Topics is only supported for English."
    }
  ]
  ```
</CodeGroup>

| Warning Name           | Warning Message                                                  |
