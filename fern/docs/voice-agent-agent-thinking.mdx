# What is the `AgentThinking` Message

The `AgentThinking` message is used to inform the client the agent is processing information.

## Receiving `AgentThinking`

The server will send an `AgentThinking` message to inform the client of a non-verbalized agent thought. When functions are available, some LLMs use these thoughts to decide which functions to call.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
    "type": "AgentThinking",
    "content": "" // The text of the agent's thought
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Conclusion

The `AgentThinking` message informs the client when the agent is processing internally, without verbalizing its thoughts. This allows the system to handle non-verbalized reasoning and, in some cases, determine which functions to call, ensuring smoother and more dynamic interactions.
