## Understanding Console Usage Log States

Within the [Deepgram Console](https://console.deepgram.com) you can view usage request logs and you may see requests in different states. Below is an explanation of what those states mean and a recommended resolution.

| State   | Meaning                                                                                  | Recommended Resolution                                         |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pending | Data on the response hasn't been recorded yet.                                           | Give the request time to process.                              |
| Unknown | We haven't confirmed the resolution of this request yet.                                 | Wait for the request to transition to Lost, Error, or Success. |
| Lost    | The resolution for this request was never logged. You won't be charged for this request. | Contact [Support](/docs/support) for assistance.               |
| Error   | This request had an error.                                                               | Retry the request.                                             |
