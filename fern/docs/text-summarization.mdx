</div>

Summarization accepts an input text and analyzes the text. It then summarizes the content of the submitted text and returns a brief summary in the JSON response.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
   "results": {
      "summary": {
        "text": "Jake calls the Honda dealership and speaks with Josh about the new Honda Civic 2023. Jake schedules a test drive for the hybrid model on Friday and provides his contact information.Josh confirms the appointment and tells Jake to call if he has any further questions."
      }
    }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Enable Feature

To enable Summarization, use the following parameter in the query string when you call Deepgram’s `/read` endpoint :

`summarize=true`

### Basic Text Request

To analyze text from a file on your computer, run the following curl command in a terminal or your favorite API client.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
   curl -vX POST \
  	-H "Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY" \
  	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  	-d '{"text": "YOUR_TEXT_HERE"}' \
  	"https://api.deepgram.com/v1/read?summarize=true&language=en"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your [Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys).
</Warning>

### Basic URL Request

To analyze text from a hosted file, run the following curl command in a terminal or your favorite API client. (Try testing it out with the hosted file [https://static.deepgram.com/examples/aura.txt](https://static.deepgram.com/examples/aura.txt))

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl -vX POST \
   -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"url": "https://YOUR_FILE_URL.txt"}' \
   "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/read?summarize=true&language=en"
  ```
