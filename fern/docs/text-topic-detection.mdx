Topic Detection accepts an input text, divides it into a list of segments comprised of sections of the text, and identifies key topics found within each segment.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
   "results": {
      "topics": {
        "segments": [
          {
            "text": "Hi I'm calling to get a refund on my recent purchase. Sure I'd be happy to help you with that. What was the number for you order?",
            "start_word": 0,
            "end_word": 26,
            "topics": [
              { "topic": "Refund", "confidence_score": 0.91318 },
              { "topic": "Order Number", "confidence_score": 0.95342 }
            ]
          },
          {
            "text": "Ok thanks for that. It looks like you made this purchase online, is that correct? Yes I ordered this online on your website a few days ago.",
            "start_word": 45,
            "end_word": 72,
            "topics": [
              {
                "topic": "Online Transacation", "confidence_score": 0.741929
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The list of topics that can be identified are not a fixed list; this TSLM powered feature is able to generate topics based on the context of the language content in the text. You may also choose to use the optional `custom-topic` parameter to provide a custom topic you want detected if present within the provided text.

## Enable Feature

To enable Topic Detection, use the following parameter in the query string when you call Deepgram’s `/read` endpoint:

`topics=true`

### Basic Text Request

To analyze text from a file on your computer, run the following curl command in a terminal or your favorite API client.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl -vX POST \
   -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"text": "YOUR_TEXT_INPUT"}' \
   "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/read?topics=true&language=en"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your [Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys).
</Warning>

### Basic URL Request

To analyze text from a hosted file, run the following curl command in a terminal or your favorite API client. (Try testing it out with the hosted file [https://static.deepgram.com/examples/aura.txt](https://static.deepgram.com/examples/aura.txt))

### Custom Topics Request

To tell the model to only return topics from your own custom list of topics, add `custom_topic_mode=strict` and `custom_topic=` followed by the list of topics. (Use the URL encoding`%20` to represent a space between each word in the list.)

If you want to return your own custom list of topics *in addition* to Deegpram's list of topics, set `custom_intent_mode=extended` and add your custom list.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl -vX POST \
   -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"text": "YOUR_TEXT_INPUT"}' \
   "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/read?topics=true&language=en&custom_topic_mode=strict&custom_topic=refund&custom_topic=online_transaction&custom_topic=Order%20Number"
  ```

## Analyze Response

When the file is finished processing, you’ll receive a JSON response that has the following basic structure:

</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  Use the [API reference](/reference/pre-recorded) or the [API Playground](https://playground.deepgram.com/) to view the detailed response.
</Info>

The response object values for `topics` are:

* `segments`: The list of segments of text identified by the model as containing notable topics.
* `topic`: The name of the topic detected by the model.
* `confidence_score`: a floating point from 0 to 1 representing the models confidence in this prediction.

## API Error Responses

### Unsupported Language

**Status** 400

If you request Topic Detection with an unsupported language by specifying a language code such as `topics=true&language=es` or `topics=true&detect_language=true` where the detected language is unsupported, you will get the error message below.
