When working with Deepgram's Text To Speech Streaming API, you may encounter WebSocket errors. This troubleshooting guide helps you quickly identify and resolve the most common issues.

## WebSocket Basics

- WebSocket enables two-way, real-time communication between client and server.
- The connection is established via an HTTP handshake and upgraded to WebSocket.
- If the handshake fails, you'll get an HTTP `4xx` or `5xx` error.
- The connection stays open until closed by either side.

### Establishing a WebSocket Connection

- The client initiates a WebSocket connection with an HTTP handshake, optionally including query parameters or headers (for authentication, etc.).
- Most libraries handle the handshake automatically (e.g., `websockets.connect`).
- If successful, the server responds with HTTP `101` and upgrades the connection.
- If unsuccessful, you'll receive an HTTP `4xx` or `5xx` error and the connection won't be established.

### Closing the WebSocket Connection

- A successfully opened WebSocket connection will stay alive until it is eventually closed by either the client or the server. When this occurs, a [WebSocket Close Frame](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-5.5.1) will be returned.
- The body of the Close frame will indicate the reason for closing with a [pre-defined status code](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-7.4.1) followed by a UTF-8-encoded payload that represents the reason for the error.
- To close the WebSocket connection from your client, send a [Close](/docs/tts-ws-close) message. The server will then finish processing any remaining data, send a final response and summary metadata, and terminate the connection.
- After sending a Close message, the endpoint considers the WebSocket connection closed and will close the underlying TCP connection.


## Common WebSocket Errors

### Failure to Connect

If a failure to connect occurs, Deepgram returns custom HTTP headers for debugging:
  - `dg-request-id`: Always present, contains the request ID.
  - `dg-error`: Present on failed upgrades, contains the error message.

<Info>
  Access to these headers will depend on the WebSocket library you are using. For example, browser-based WebSocket libraries like the JavaScript WebSocket library only allow access to HTTP header information for successful WebSocket connections.
</Info>

### Debugging Connection Failures

If you're unable to connect the Deepgram API provides custom HTTP headers that contain debugging information:

* Regardless of the success or failure of the WebSocket upgrade, all requests include the `dg-request-id` HTTP header, which contains the request ID.
* Requests that do not successfully upgrade to a WebSocket connection also include the `dg-error` HTTP header, which contains a detailed error message concerning why the connection could not be upgraded. This error message is also sent back in the body of the HTTP response.

### Abrupt WebSocket Closures

If Deepgram encounters an error during real-time streaming, the Deepgram API returns a [WebSocket Close frame](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455#section-5.5.1). The body of the Close frame will indicate the reason for closing with a [pre-defined status code](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-7.4.1) followed by a UTF-8-encoded payload that represents the reason for the error.

Below are the most common WebSocket Close frame status codes and their descriptions.

| Code | Payload      | Description                                             |
| :--- | :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1003 | MESSAGE-0000 | Input message isn't a supported websocket message type. |
| 1008 | DATA-0000    | Input message isn't recognized as a valid command.      |
| 1008 | DATA-0001    | Too many input characters submitted in recent time window.      |
| 1009 | BIG-0000     | Input message is too large.                             |
| 1009 | BIG-0001     | Input text has too many characters.                     |
| 1011 | NET-0000     | Internal server error.                                  |
| 1011 | NET-0001     | Failed to receive message.                              |
| 1011 | NET-0002     | Failed to send message.                                 |
| 1011 | NET-0003     | Time limit exceeded.                                    |


#### Troubleshooting `1003` - `MESSAGE-0000`
- Ensure you are sending supported TTS WebSocket message types of `text`.
- Refer to the [Documentation](/reference/text-to-speech-api/speak-streaming) for valid message types.

#### Troubleshooting `1008` - `DATA-0000`
- Make sure your message is a valid message type.
- Refer to the [Documentation](/reference/text-to-speech-api/speak-streaming) for valid message types.

#### Troubleshooting `1008` - `DATA-0001`
- Reduce the rate at which you are sending characters into the websocket via input messages.
- The limit is on the total number of characters submitted for speaking, not the distinct number of input messages used to submit those characters.
- Check the [Documentation](/docs/errors#413-input-text-exceeded-character-limit) for the maximum allowed character limit.

#### Troubleshooting `1009` - `BIG-0000
- Reduce the size of your input message.
- If sending large blocks of text, consider splitting it into smaller chunks.
- Check the [Documentation](/docs/errors#413-request-body-exceeded-2mb) for the maximum allowed request body size.

#### Troubleshooting `1009` - `BIG-0001`
- Shorten your input text to stay within character limits.
- Check the [Documentation](/docs/errors#413-input-text-exceeded-character-limit) for the maximum allowed character limit.

#### Troubleshooting `1011` - `NET-0000`
- This indicates an internal server error.
- Retry your request.
- If the error persists, check [Deepgram status](https://status.deepgram.com/) for outages.
- [Contact Support](/docs/support) if the issue continues.

#### Troubleshooting `1011` - `NET-0001`
- The server did not receive a message from the client in time.
- Ensure your client is sending data promptly after connecting.
- Check for network issues or dropped connections.
- Retry the connection if needed.

#### Troubleshooting `1011` - `NET-0002`
- The server failed to send a message to the client.
- Check your network connection and firewall settings.
- Retry the request.
- If the problem persists, [contact Support](/docs/support).

#### Troubleshooting `1011` - `NET-0003`
- The request took too long to complete (time limit exceeded).
- Try reducing the size or complexity of your request.
- Ensure your client is not waiting too long before sending or receiving data.
- Retry the request if appropriate.
