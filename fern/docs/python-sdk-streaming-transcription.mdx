## Declaring a Deepgram Websocket

The Deepgram [`Live Clients`](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/tree/main/deepgram/clients/listen/v1/websocket) allows you to obtain Real-Time Transcription through the Websocket Streaming interface.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Threaded

  # Configure the DeepgramClientOptions to enable KeepAlive for maintaining the WebSocket connection (only if necessary to your scenario)
  config = DeepgramClientOptions(
      options={"keepalive": "true"}
  )

  # Create a websocket connection using the DEEPGRAM_API_KEY from environment variables
  deepgram = DeepgramClient(API_KEY, config)

  # Use the listen.live class to create the websocket connection
  dg_connection = deepgram.listen.websocket.v("1")
  ```

  ```python Async

  # Configure the DeepgramClientOptions to enable KeepAlive for maintaining the WebSocket connection (only if necessary to your scenario)
  config = DeepgramClientOptions(
      options={"keepalive": "true"}
  )

  # Create a websocket connection using the DEEPGRAM_API_KEY from environment variables
  deepgram = DeepgramClient(API_KEY, config)

  # Use the listen.live class to create the websocket connection
  dg_connection = deepgram.listen.asyncwebsocket.v("1")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  This SDK supports both the Threaded and Async/Await Clients as described in the [Threaded and Async IO Task Support](/docs/threaded-and-async-io-task-support) section. The code blocks contain a tab for `Threaded` and `Async` to show examples for `websocket` versus `asyncwebsocket`, respectively. The difference between `Threaded` and `Async` is subtle.
</Info>

If your scenario requires you to keep the connection alive even while data is not being sent to Deepgram, you can send periodic KeepAlive messages to essentially "pause" the connection without closing it. By setting `"keepalive": "true"` in the `DeepgramClientOptions` object, you enable KeepAlive to maintain the WebSocket connection, ensuring a more stable and persistent connection with Deepgram's servers.

<Info>
  Read more about KeepAlive in [this comprehensive guide](/docs/keep-alive)
</Info>

## Parameters

Additional options can be provided for streaming transcriptions when the websocket `start()` function is called. They are provided by declaring a `LiveOptions` object. Each of these parameters maps to a feature in the Deepgram API. Reference the [features documentation](/docs/features-overview) to learn the appropriate features for your request.

## Declaring a Deepgram Websocket

The `listen` package declares a websocket object to the Deepgram API.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Threaded
  # Create a websocket connection using the DEEPGRAM_API_KEY from environment variables
  dg_connection = deepgram.listen.websocket.v("1")
  ```

  ```python Async
  # Create a websocket connection using the DEEPGRAM_API_KEY from environment variables
  dg_connection = deepgram.listen.asyncwebsocket.v("1")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Events and Callbacks

The following events are fired by the live transcription object:

| Event      | Description                                                  | Data                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Metadata` | Metadata (or information) regarding the websocket connection | Metadata object                                                                                                                                |
| `Error`    | An error occurred with the websocket connection              | Error object                                                                                                                                   |
| `Results`  | Deepgram has responded with a transcription                  | [Transcription Response](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/blob/main/deepgram/clients/listen/v1/websocket/response.py#L165-L200) |

### Listening to Events

Use the `on` function to listen for events fired by the websocket object.

Listen for any transcripts to be received and receive a callback to your declared function called `on_message`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Threaded
  def on_message(self, result, **kwargs):
    sentence = result.channel.alternatives[0].transcript
    if len(sentence) == 0:
      return
    print(f"Transcription: {sentence}")

  dg_connection.on(LiveTranscriptionEvents.Transcript, on_message)
  ```

  ```python Async
  async def on_message(self, result, **kwargs):
    sentence = result.channel.alternatives[0].transcript
    if len(sentence) == 0:
      return
    print(f"Transcription: {sentence}")

  dg_connection.on(LiveTranscriptionEvents.Transcript, on_message)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Listen for any errors/exceptions and receive a callback to your declared function called `on_error`

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Threaded
  def on_error(self, error, **kwargs):
    print(f"Error: {error}")

  dg_connection.on(LiveTranscriptionEvents.Error, on_error)
  ```

  ```python Async
  async def on_error(self, error, **kwargs):
    print(f"Error: {error}")

  dg_connection.on(LiveTranscriptionEvents.Error, on_error)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Connecting Your Websocket

After you have declared your callbacks, declare the `LiveOptions` or the transcription parameters you want to use for your websocket connection. These options are passed into the `start()` function, which will subsequently connect the websocket to the Deepgram API.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Threaded
  options = LiveOptions(
    punctuate=True,
    interim_results=False,
    language='en-GB'
  )

  dg_connection.start(options)
  ```

  ```python Async
  options = LiveOptions(
    punctuate=True,
    interim_results=False,
    language='en-GB'
  )

  await dg_connection.start(options)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Functions

The Deepgram websocket class provides several functions to simplify using the Deepgram API. The most notable ones are `send` and `finish`.

### Sending Audio Stream Bytes

The `send` function sends raw audio data to the Deepgram API.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Threaded
  dg_connection.send(SOME_STREAMING_DATA)
  ```

  ```python Async
  await dg_connection.send(SOME_STREAMING_DATA)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

When transcription results are available, you will receive those messages via the callback function previously mentioned (as seen below).

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Threaded
  def on_message(self, result, **kwargs):
    sentence = result.channel.alternatives[0].transcript
    if len(sentence) == 0:
      return
    print(f"Transcription: {sentence}")

  dg_connection.on(LiveTranscriptionEvents.Transcript, on_message)
  ```

  ```python Async
  async def on_message(self, result, **kwargs):
    sentence = result.channel.alternatives[0].transcript
    if len(sentence) == 0:
      return
    print(f"Transcription: {sentence}")

  dg_connection.on(LiveTranscriptionEvents.Transcript, on_message)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Closing the Connection

The `finish` function closes the Websocket connection to Deepgram.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Threaded
  dg_connection.finish()
  ```

  ```python Async
  await dg_connection.finish()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Where To Find Additional Examples

The SDK repository has a good collection of live audio transcription examples. The [README](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#examples) contains links to them. Each example below attempts to provide different options for transcribing an audio source.

Some Examples:

* Threaded Client using a Microphone - [examples/speech-to-text/websocket/microphone](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/tree/main/examples/speech-to-text/websocket/microphone)
* Threaded Client from an HTTP Endpoint - [examples/speech-to-text/websocket/http](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/blob/main/examples/speech-to-text/websocket/http/main.py)

If the Async Client suits your use case better:

* Async Client using a Microphone - [examples/speech-to-text/websocket/async\_microphone](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/tree/main/examples/speech-to-text/websocket/async_microphone)
* Async Client from an HTTP Endpoint - [examples/speech-to-text/websocket/async\_http](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/blob/main/examples/speech-to-text/websocket/async_http/main.py)
