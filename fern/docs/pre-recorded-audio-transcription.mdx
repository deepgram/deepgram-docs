title: Pre-Recorded Audio Transcription
subtitle: >-
  The Deepgram  has a  package that allows you to request transcripts for
  pre-recorded audio. To request a transcript for a pre-recorded particular
  audio file, you'll use one of the following functions depending on your audio
  source:
slug: docs/pre-recorded-audio-transcription
---


* [`FromFile`](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/pkg/api/listen/v1/rest/rest.go#L30)
* [`FromStream`](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/pkg/api/listen/v1/rest/rest.go#L37)
* [`FromURL`](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/pkg/api/listen/v1/rest/rest.go#L44)

## Pre-recorded Transcription Parameters

The input parameters for the three types of Prerecorded transcription (FromFile, FromStream, and FromURL) are geared toward the type of audio source.

| Parameter | Type                        | Description                                |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| ctx       | Context                     | Go Context                                 |
| source    | FilePath, io.Reader, or URL | Provides the source of audio to transcribe |
| options   | Object                      | Parameters to filter requests. See below.  |

### Sending a URL

<CodeGroup>
  ```go Go
  ctx := context.Background()

  URL := "https://my-domain.com/files/MyAudio.mp3"

  options := PreRecordedTranscriptionOptions{
  	Punctuate:  true,
  	Diarize:    true,
  	Language:   "en-US",
  }

  res, err := dg.FromURL(ctx, URL, options)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Sending a Local File

<CodeGroup>
  ```go Go
  ctx := context.Background()

  filePath := "./MyAudio.mp3"

  options := PreRecordedTranscriptionOptions{
  	Punctuate:  true,
  	Diarize:    true,
  	Language:   "en-US",
  }

  res, err := dg.FromFile(ctx, filePath, options)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**NOTE:** When attempting to access a file for transcription, make sure you have the correct file permissions for the user on the filesystem.

### Sending an io.Reader

The [io.Reader](https://pkg.go.dev/io#Reader) is a standard Go interface used primarily for streaming bytes from various sources. These sources could include files, HTTP(S) endpoints, etc. Anything that implements this interface can be passed to stream bytes for transcription.

<CodeGroup>
  ```go Go
  ctx := context.Background()

  // myStream could be something like a file, HTTP stream, etc

  options := PreRecordedTranscriptionOptions{
  	Punctuate:  true,
  	Diarize:    true,
  	Language:   "en-US",
  }

  res, err := dg.FromStream(ctx, myStream, options)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Pre-recorded Transcription Options

Additional transcription options can be provided for pre-recorded transcriptions. They are provided as an object as the second parameter of the transcription function. Each of these parameters maps to a feature in the Deepgram API. Reference the [features documentation](/docs/features-overview) to learn the appropriate features for your request.

## Pre-recorded Transcription Example Request

Using the transcription from a URL functionality above ([`FromURL`](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/pkg/api/listen/v1/rest/rest.go#L44)), the required inputs are a Go Context, a URL, and [additional transcription options](#pre-recorded-transcription-options). The output will be of type [\`PreRecordedResponse'](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/pkg/api/listen/v1/rest/interfaces/types.go#L228), which contains the conversation transcription based on the options provided.

<CodeGroup>
  ```go Go
  // context
  ctx := context.Background()

  //client
  c := client.NewRESTWithDefaults()
  dg := prerecorded.New(c)

  // transcription options
  options := PreRecordedTranscriptionOptions{
  	Punctuate:  true,
  	Diarize:    true,
  	Language:   "en-US",
  }

  // send URL
  URL := "https://my-domain.com/files/my-conversation.mp3"
  res, err := dg.FromURL(ctx, URL, options)
  if err != nil {
  	log.Fatalf("FromURL failed. Err: %v\n", err)
  }

  // do something with the result
  log.Printf("result: %v\n", res)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Where To Find Additional Examples

The repository has a good collection of live audio transcription examples. You can find links to them in the [README](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/README.md#examples). Each example below will attempt to provide different options for transcribing an audio source.

* From an Audio File - [examples/prerecorded/file](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/speech-to-text/rest/file/main.go)
* From an URL - [examples/prerecorded/url](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/speech-to-text/rest/url/main.go)
* From an Audio Stream - [examples/prerecorded/stream](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/speech-to-text/rest/stream/main.go)

For larger files, you might need to increase the default HTTP Timeout setting, which is 300 seconds (or 5 mins).
