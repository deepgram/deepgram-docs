# What is the `Welcome` Message

The welcome message confirms there has been a successful connection to the websocket.

## Receiving `Welcome`

The server will immediately send a `Welcome` message as soon as the websocket opens.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
    "type": "Welcome",
    "session_id": "fc553ec9-5874-49ca-a47c-b670d525a4b1"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Conclusion

The `Welcome` message serves as the initial handshake between a voice agent and the server, signaling that the websocket connection is successfully established. By including a unique `session_id`, it ensures that each interaction is traceable and distinct, providing a reliable foundation for managing ongoing communication. This message is critical for synchronizing the client and server, enabling the voice agent to proceed with further actions seamlessly.
