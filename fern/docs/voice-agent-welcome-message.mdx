The welcome message confirms there has been a successful connection to the websocket.

## Purpose

The `Welcome` message serves as the initial handshake between a voice agent and the server, signaling that the websocket connection is successfully established. By including a unique `request_id`, it ensures that each interaction is traceable and distinct. This message is critical for synchronizing the client and server, enabling a voice agent to proceed with further actions.

## Example Payload

The server will immediately send a `Welcome` message as soon as the websocket opens.
