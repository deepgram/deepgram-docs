@TODO: Add documentation for the Voice Agent Warning message.

* INJECT_AGENT_MESSAGE_DURING_USER_SPEECH
* INJECT_AGENT_MESSAGE_DURING_AGENT_SPEECH
* PROMPT_TOO_LONG

in terms of the behavior, we have:
"Ignored InjectAgentMessage because the user is currently speaking."
"Ignored InjectAgentMessage because the agent is already in the middle of a reply."
"The prompt was too long and had to be truncated."
