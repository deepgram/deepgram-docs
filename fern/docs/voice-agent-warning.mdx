# What is the `Warning` Message

A notification from the server to the client of a non-fatal error or warning.

## Receiving `Warning`

The server will send a `Warning` message to the client to notify the client of possible issues.

```json
{
  "type": "Warning",
  "description": "" // A description of the warning
  "code": "" // The code of the warning
}
```

## Types of Warnings

| Warning | Message | Recommended Resolution |
|---------|---------|----------------------|
| `INJECT_AGENT_MESSAGE_DURING_USER_SPEECH` | InjectAgentMessage was ignored during user speech. | Wait for the user to finish speaking before attempting to inject a new agent message. |
| `INJECT_AGENT_MESSAGE_DURING_AGENT_SPEECH` | InjectAgentMessage was ignored during agent speech. | Wait for the agent to complete its current response before injecting a new message. |
| `PROMPT_TOO_LONG` | The prompt was too long and had to be truncated. | Reduce the length of your prompt to fit within the maximum allowed size limit. |

## Conclusion

The `Warning` message is a non-fatal error or warning that the server will send to the client to
notify the client of possible issues. If you receive a `Warning` message, check the warning code and description to identify the specific issue. Follow the recommended resolution and implement appropriate error handling.

Warnings are non-fatal and your application should continue to function normally.
