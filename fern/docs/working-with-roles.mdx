Deepgram uses a tiered system of access control to provide granular access to its endpoints. These tiers include account (or global) permissions and project permissions. Applying different tiers of permissions allows for more granularity at the project level. For example, an account may have the `project:kick` permission for one project but not for another project.

## Account Roles

At the account level, certain permissions imply other specific permissions. For example, an account that has access to the `project:write` permission also implicitly has access to the `project:read` permission. Similarly, `account:write` access implies access to every other account permission.

## Project Roles

At the project level, users can have access to several roles, including `owner`, `admin`, and `member`, which, similar to account permissions, imply access to another set of permissions:

| Project Role | Implicit Project Permissions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Self-Hosted Product Scopes

Deepgram self-hosted users have been assigned self-hosted product scopes in accordance with their contracts. Any user with these scopes may create [self-hosted API keys and distribution credentials](/docs/self-hosted-self-service-tutorial).

The full list of self-hosted product scopes is as follows:

| Product Scope                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `self-hosted:product:api` `self-hosted:product:engine` `self-hosted:product:license-proxy` `self-hosted:product:dgtools` `self-hosted:product:billing` `self-hosted:product:hotpepper` `self-hosted:product:metrics-server` |

The `self-hosted:products` scope can be provided at self-hosted API key or distribution credentials creation time as a short-hand which implies all available self-hosted product scopes.

For example an API key has the `self-hosted:product:api`, `self-hosted:product:engine`, and `self-hosted:product:license-proxy` scopes granted to it. For requests authenticated with that API key, the use of `self-hosted:products` would imply all of those scopes when included in a key creation request.

| Product Scope          | Example of Implicit Product Scopes                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `self-hosted:products` | `self-hosted:product:api` `self-hosted:product:engine` `self-hosted:product:license-proxy` |

### Product Scopes and Project Roles

Self-hosted API keys can also be created with Console project roles. To do so, simply include the desired role in the same `scopes` list as the self-hosted product scopes when submitting the key creation request.

Here is an example of an self-hosted API key which includes both the `member` project role as well as the `self-hosted:products` scopes.
