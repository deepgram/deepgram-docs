The Deepgram JavaScript SDK now works in both server and browser environments. A proxy configuration is required for browser environments (see the section below).

## Installing the SDK

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript TypeScript
  # Install the Deepgram JS SDK
  # https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-js-sdk

  npm install @deepgram/sdk
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Initializing the SDK

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript TypeScript
  import { createClient } from "@deepgram/sdk";

  const deepgram = createClient("DEEPGRAM_API_KEY");
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Transcribing a file by URL

Any public audio or video file can be used.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript TypeScript
  const { result, error } = await deepgram.listen.prerecorded.transcribeUrl(
    {
      url: "https://dpgr.am/spacewalk.wav"
    },
    {
      model: "nova-3"
    }
  );
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Transcribing a file buffer

Any `ArrayBufferLike` can be sent as the body. This includes file buffers from Node's `fs.readFile`/`fs.readFileSync`, or a `Blob.arrayBuffer()` in a browser client.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript TypeScript
  const { result, error } = await deepgram.listen.prerecorded.transcribeFile(
    fs.readFileSync("./examples/spacewalk.wav"),
    {
      model: "nova-3",
    }
  );
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Transcribing a file stream

Any `ReadStream` can be sent as the body. This includes a stream from Node's `fs.createReadStream`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript TypeScript
  const { result, error } = await deepgram.listen.prerecorded.transcribeFile(
    fs.createReadStream("./examples/spacewalk.wav"),
    {
      model: "nova-3",
    }
  );
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Pre-recorded Transcription Options

Transcription options are provided as an object to our transcription functions. Each of these parameters are found as unique features on the [Pre-Recorded API reference](/reference/pre-recorded).

## Helper Functions

In the latest SDK version, caption formatting has been has been published as a [standalone package](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-js-captions) and built into the SDK. You can use an import statement to invoke caption functionality from the stand alone caption package.

### Formatting as WebVTT

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript JavaScript
  import { createClient } from "@deepgram/sdk";
  import { webvtt } from "@deepgram/captions";
  // - or -
  // import { createClient, webvtt } from "@deepgram/sdk";

  const deepgram = createClient("DEEPGRAM_API_KEY");

  const { result, error } = await deepgram.listen.prerecorded.transcribeUrl(
    {
      url: "https://dpgr.am/spacewalk.wav"
    },
    {
      model: "nova-3",
    }
  );

  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }

  const captions = webvtt(result);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Formatting as SRT

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript JavaScript
  import { createClient } from "@deepgram/sdk";
  import { srt } from "@deepgram/captions";
  // - or -
  // import { createClient, webvtt } from "@deepgram/sdk";

  const deepgram = createClient("DEEPGRAM_API_KEY");

  const { result, error } = await deepgram.listen.prerecorded.transcribeUrl(
    {
      url: "https://dpgr.am/spacewalk.wav"
    },
    {
      model: "nova-3",
    }
  );

  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }

  const captions = srt(result);
  ```
