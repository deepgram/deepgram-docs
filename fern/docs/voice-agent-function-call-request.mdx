# What is the `FunctionCallRequest` Message

The `FunctionCallRequest` message is used to initiate function calls in your Voice Agent. This message can trigger either a server-side function execution or request a client-side function execution, depending on the `client_side` property setting.

## Receiving `FunctionCallRequest`

<Info>
  If you leave the `client_side` property set to `false` you will be instructing your Agent to execute a server side function call.
</Info>

If a function is client-side and the `client_side` property is set to `true` then the server will request to call the function by sending the client a `FunctionCallRequest` message. Upon receiving this message, the client should perform the requested function call and reply with a [Function Call Response](/docs/voice-agent-function-call-response) containing the function's output.

  ```json JSON
  {
    "type": "FunctionCallRequest",
    "functions": [
      {
        "id": "fc_12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef",
        "name": "check_order_status",
        "arguments": "{\"order_id\": \"ORD-123456\"}",
        "client_side": true
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Conclusion

When a function is client-side and the `client_side` property is set to `true`, the server will trigger the function call by sending a `FunctionCallRequest` message. The client is then responsible for executing the function and responding with a [Function Call Response](/docs/voice-agent-function-call-response) containing the function's result.

If you leave the `client_side` property set to `false` you will be instructing your Agent to execute a server side function call. In this case the server will execute the function call and respond with a [Function Call Response](/docs/voice-agent-function-call-response) containing the function's result.
