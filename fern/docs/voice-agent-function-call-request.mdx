# What is the `FunctionCallRequest` Message

The `FunctionCallRequest` message is sent by. the Voice Agent. This message will either represent a request for internal function call, or request a client-defined function call, depending on the `client_side` property setting.

## Receiving `FunctionCallRequest`

<Info>
  The `client_side` property is set by the server to indicate how the function should be handled.
</Info>

When the server sends a `FunctionCallRequest`, it includes the `client_side` property to tell the client whether the function should be handled locally or not.  
- If `client_side` is `false`, the server will handle the function using built-in tools.  
- If `client_side` is `true`, the client is expected to handle the function call and respond with a [Function Call Response](/docs/voice-agent-function-call-response) containing the result.

    ]
  }

## Conclusion

When the server sends a `FunctionCallRequest`, it includes the `client_side` property to indicate how the function should be handled:

* If `client_side` is `true`, the client is expected to execute the function and respond with a [[Function Call Response](https://github.com/docs/voice-agent-function-call-response)](/docs/voice-agent-function-call-response) containing the result.
* If `client_side` is `false`, the server will handle the function internally and reply with the result using a [[Function Call Response](https://github.com/docs/voice-agent-function-call-response)](/docs/voice-agent-function-call-response).
