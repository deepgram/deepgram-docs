# What is The `FunctionCallRequest` Message

The `FunctionCallRequest` message is used to call a function from the server to the client.

## Receiving `FunctionCallRequest`

If a function is client-side and no URL is provided for that function in the [Settings Configuration](/docs/voice-agent-settings-configuration) then the server will request to call the function by sending the client a `FunctionCallRequest` message. Upon receiving this message, the client should perform the requested function call and reply with a [Function Call Response](/docs/voice-agent-function-call-response) containing the function's output.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
    "type": "FunctionCallRequest",
    "function_name": "", // The `name` you gave in the function definition
    "function_call_id": "", // ID to be passed back in the `FunctionCallResponse`
    "input": {...} // A JSON value containing the `parameters` you defined for this function
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Conclusion

When a function is client-side and no URL is provided in the [Settings Configuration](/docs/voice-agent-settings-configuration), the server will trigger the function call by sending a `FunctionCallRequest` message. The client is then responsible for executing the function and responding with a [Function Call Response](/docs/voice-agent-function-call-response) containing the function's result.
