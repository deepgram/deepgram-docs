The `FunctionCallRequest` message is sent by the Voice Agent server to request a function call. The handling of this call—whether the server executes it or expects the client to—depends on the `client_side` flag.

## Purpose

This message is used to trigger either a built-in server-side function or a custom function defined by the client.

- When `client_side` is `false`, the server will handle the function using built-in logic.
- When `client_side` is `true`, the client must handle the function and respond with a [`FunctionCallResponse`](./voice-agent-function-call-response).

## Handling the message

<Info>
  The `client_side` property is set by the server to indicate where the function should be executed.
</Info>

When your client receives a `FunctionCallRequest`:

1. Check the `client_side` field.
2. If it's `true`, call the appropriate client-defined function.
3. Return a `FunctionCallResponse` message with the function result.
4. If it's `false`, no client action is needed; the server will handle it internally.

## Example payload

```json
{
  "type": "FunctionCallRequest",
  "functions": [
    {
      "id": "fc_12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef",
      "name": "get_weather",
      "arguments": "{\"location\": \"Fremont, CA 94539\"}",
      "client_side": true
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, the server is requesting that the client execute a function named `get_weather` with the given arguments.

## Related messages

* [`FunctionCallResponse`](./voice-agent-function-call-response): The expected response from the client when `client_side` is `true`.
