# What is the `FunctionCallRequest` Message

The `FunctionCallRequest` message is sent by. the Voice Agent. This message will either represent a request for internal function call, or request a client-defined function call, depending on the `client_side` property setting.

## Receiving `FunctionCallRequest`

<Info>
  The `client_side` property is set by the server to indicate how the function should be handled.
</Info>

When the server sends a `FunctionCallRequest`, it includes the `client_side` property to tell the client whether the function should be handled locally or not.  
- If `client_side` is `false`, the server will handle the function using built-in tools.  
- If `client_side` is `true`, the client is expected to handle the function call and respond with a [Function Call Response](/docs/voice-agent-function-call-response) containing the result.

        "name": "check_order_status",
        "arguments": "{\"order_id\": \"ORD-123456\"}",

      }
    ]
  }
  ```

## Conclusion

When a function is client-side and the `client_side` property is set to `true`, the server will trigger the function call by sending a `FunctionCallRequest` message. The client is then responsible for executing the function and responding with a [Function Call Response](/docs/voice-agent-function-call-response) containing the function's result.

If you leave the `client_side` property set to `false` you will be instructing your Agent to execute a server side function call. In this case the server will execute the function call and respond with a [Function Call Response](/docs/voice-agent-function-call-response) containing the function's result.
