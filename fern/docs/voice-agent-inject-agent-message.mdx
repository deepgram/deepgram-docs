The`InjectAgentMessage` message is a JSON message you can send to immediately trigger an agent statement.

## Purpose

The `InjectAgentMessage` message provides a way to immediately trigger an agent response during a conversation. However, it must be carefully timed, as the request will be ignored if the user is speaking or if the agent is already responding. To ensure successful injection, the client should only attempt it during silent moments, avoiding interruptions and potential `InjectionRefused` errors.

<Info>
The client should only try to inject agent messages during silent portions of the conversation.
</Info>


## Example Payloads

To send the `InjectAgentMessage` message, you need to send the following JSON message to the server:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
    "type": "InjectAgentMessage",
    "message": "" // The statement the agent should say
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

After completing the agent's speech audio transmission, the server sends an [`AgentAudioDone`](/docs/voice-agent-agent-audio-done) message.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
      "type": "AgentAudioDone"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The server will send an `InjectionRefused` message when an `InjectAgentMessage` request is ignored because it arrived while the user was speaking or while the server was sending audio for an agent response.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
      "type": "InjectionRefused"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Use Cases

Some common ways to use the `injectAgentMessage` are:

* Informing the user that the agent is working on a lengthy function call ("Hold on while I look that up for you")
* Prompting the user to continue if the user hasn't spoken for a while ("Are you still on the line?")
