title: Supported Entity Types
subtitle: A list of supported entity types.
slug: docs/supported-entity-types
---


Deepgram can [detect](/docs/detect-entities), [format](/docs/smart-format), and [redact](/docs/redaction) over 50 unique entity types. The complete inventory of supported entity types is listed in the charts below, divided into four groups: PII (Personally Identifiable Information), PHI (Protected Health Information), PCI (Payment Card Industry), and Other Entities.

Note that some entities, such as `name` and `location`, also have subtypes. For instance, `location_city` is a subtype of `location`. This means that, in a phrase such as *I live in Boston*, the location name *Boston* will be detected as both `location` and `location_city`, with the more specific label (in this case, `location_city`) appearing in the output. Other entity types are groupings of related categories. For example, `healthcare_number` captures health plan beneficiary numbers and medical record numbers, both of which are outlined as identifiers in the HIPAA Safe Harbor provision. Similarly, `numerical_pii` covers a broad range of entity types such as MAC addresses and cookie IDs.

While entity types have English names, international variants are also redacted. For example, `ssn` covers American Social Security Numbers, as well as many equivalent identification numbers used in different regions worldwide, such as the Canadian Social Insurance Number or the German Sozialversicherungsnummer.

## Redacting Certain Entities

When using Deepgram's hosted pre-recorded product, our redaction functionality can redact over 50 unique entity types.

Individual entity classes can be redacted with `redact=entity_class`.

<Warning>
  This functionality is only available for Deepgram's hosted and pre-recorded transcription product. When using Deepgram's self-hosted offering or live streaming product, only the basic [Redaction](/docs/redaction) functionality is available.
