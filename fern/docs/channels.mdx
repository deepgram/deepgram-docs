The default value is `1`.

The Channels feature is used when the [Encoding](/docs/encoding/) feature is also being used to submit streaming raw audio. It is not read at any other time.

## Enable Feature

To enable Channels, when you call Deepgramâ€™s API, add a `channels` parameter in the query string and set it to the number of channels in your submitted audio.

`channels=NUMBER_OF_CHANNELS`
