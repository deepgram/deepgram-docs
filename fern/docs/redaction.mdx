## Enable Feature

To enable redaction, use the following parameter in the query string when you call Deepgramâ€™s `/listen` endpoint:

`redact=OPTION`

### Pre-Recorded

#### Redacting Common Entities

Deepgram provides the following options to redact common groups of entities:

* `pci`: Redacts credit card information, including credit card number, expiration date, and CVV.
* `pii`: Redacts personally identifiable information, including names and locations and complete and 4 digit social security numbers.
* `numbers` (or `true`): Redacts numerical entities, such as dates and account numbers.

#### Redacting Specific Entities

When submitting pre-recorded audio to Deepgram's hosted endpoint (`api.deepgram.com`), you may select the types of entities you wish to redact from [over 50 supported entity types](/docs/supported-entity-types). This powerful functionality allows you total control over what is redacted in your transcript.

Some options include `credit_card`, `credit_card_expiration`, `cvv`, and `email_address`.

View all options here: [Supported Entity Types](/docs/supported-entity-types)

#### Examples

You can enable redaction by adding `redact=OPTION` as a query parameter.

To transcribe audio and remove `PCI` data from an audio file run the following cURL command:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl \
    --request POST \
    --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
    --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \
    --data-binary @youraudio.wav \
    --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?redact=pci'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Multiple types of entities can be redacted with the syntax `redact=option_1&redact=option_2`. To transcribe audio and remove `PCI` and `PII` data from an audio file run the following cURL command:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl \
    --request POST \
    --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
    --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \
    --data-binary @youraudio.wav \
    --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?redact=pci&redact=pii'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your [Deepgram API Key](/docs/create-additional-api-keys).
</Warning>

### Streaming

<Info>
   To ensure redaction operates with the highest accuracy, set `no_delay=false` or avoid including `no_delay` altogether. If `no_delay=true` is set, our system will opt for low latency at the risk of redaction performance.
</Info>

When live-streaming audio to Deepgram's hosted endpoint, redaction options include:

* `pci`: Redacts sensitive credit card information, including credit card number, expiration date, and CVV.
* `numbers` (or `true`): Redacts series of three or more consecutive numerals.
* `aggressive_numbers`: Redacts all numerals.
* `ssn`: Redacts complete social security numbers.
* Multiple redaction values can be sent: `redact=pci&redact=numbers`

## Results

For both Live-streaming and Pre-recorded audio, Redaction replaces redacted content with the type of entity redacted and the number of times that entity has been detected in the transcript. For example, if you choose to redact social security numbers, the phrase "My social security number is five five five two two one one one one and his is six six six two two one three three three" would appear in your transcript as "My social security number is \[SSN\_1] and his is \[SSN\_2]".

Example with `redact=pci&redact=pii`:
