title: Build A Function Call
subtitle: Learn how to build a Function Call to use with your Agent.
slug: docs/build-a-function-call
---

This guide walks you through how to build a simple function call for a demo application. Please refer to this [code repository](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/flask-agent-function-calling-demo) for the complete application code.

## Getting Started

We'll be creating 2 files called `agent_functions.py` and `agent_templates.py`.

`agent_functions.py` will define a collection of functions and configurations which can be used in a Voice Agent API system for customer service automation. These functions will handle customer lookups, appointments, and order management through a set of async functions and standardized function definitions.

`agent_templates.py` will define the prompt and settings for the Voice Agent as well as the factory class `AgentTemplates` which will be used to configure the Voice Agent for different industries.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7+
* Familiarity with Python
* An understanding of how to use Python Virtual environments.
* Familiarity with the [Deepgram Voice Agent API](/reference/build-a-voice-agent)

## Create the file & set up the dependencies

<Info>
  This guide doesn't cover the development of the **business logic** for this application. Please see [business_logic.py](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/flask-agent-function-calling-demo/blob/main/common/business_logic.py)for more details.
</Info>

First, create a file called: `agent_functions.py`. Then in `agent_functions.py` set up the dependencies and import the business logic.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  import json
  from datetime import datetime, timedelta
  import asyncio
  from business_logic import (
      get_customer,
      get_customer_appointments,
      get_customer_orders,
      schedule_appointment,
      get_available_appointment_slots,
      prepare_agent_filler_message,
      prepare_farewell_message
  )
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Implement the Functions

In the `agent_functions.py` file we'll start by implementing the customer lookup function:

This function handles:

* Multiple lookup methods (phone, email, ID)
* Standardized ID formatting (CUSTXXXX)
* Phone number normalization (+1XXXXXXXXXX)
* Email address parsing

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  async def find_customer(params):
      """Look up a customer by phone, email, or ID."""
      phone = params.get("phone")
      email = params.get("email")
      customer_id = params.get("customer_id")

      result = await get_customer(phone=phone, email=email, customer_id=customer_id)
      return result
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Next in the same file we'll create a function to find customer appointments for a specific customer:

This function handles:

* retrieving all appointments for a specific customer using their customer ID.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  async def get_appointments(params):
      """Get appointments for a customer."""
      customer_id = params.get("customer_id")
      if not customer_id:
          return {"error": "customer_id is required"}

      result = await get_customer_appointments(customer_id)
      return result
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Next in the same file we'll create a function to do appointment management:

This function handles:

* Scheduling new appointments
* Checking availability
* Retrieving existing appointments

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  async def get_orders(params):
      """Get orders for a customer."""
      customer_id = params.get("customer_id")
      if not customer_id:
          return {"error": "customer_id is required"}

      result = await get_customer_orders(customer_id)
      return result
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Next in the same file we'll create a function to do order management:

This function handles:

* Order history lookup
* Order status checking

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  async def create_appointment(params):
      """Schedule a new appointment."""
      customer_id = params.get("customer_id")
      date = params.get("date")
      service = params.get("service")

      if not all([customer_id, date, service]):
          return {"error": "customer_id, date, and service are required"}

      result = await schedule_appointment(customer_id, date, service)
      return result
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Next in the same file we'll create a function to find available appointment times:

This function handles:

* Finding available appointment slots
* Pre-scheduling availability checks
* Responding to "When can I come in?" queries

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  async def check_availability(params):
      """Check available appointment slots."""
      start_date = params.get("start_date")
      end_date = params.get("end_date", (datetime.fromisoformat(start_date) + timedelta(days=7)).isoformat())

      if not start_date:
          return {"error": "start_date is required"}

      result = await get_available_appointment_slots(start_date, end_date)
      return result
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Next in the same file we'll setup a function to handle conversational flow:

This function handles:

* Agent filler messages for natural interaction
* Proper conversation closure handling

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python

  async def agent_filler(websocket, params):
      """
      Handle agent filler messages while maintaining proper function call protocol.
      """
      result = await prepare_agent_filler_message(websocket, **params)
      return result
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Finally in the same file we'll create a function to end the call gracefully.

This function handles:

* Conversation closure
* Adding appropriate farewell messages

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python

  async def end_call(websocket, params):
      """
      End the conversation and close the connection.
      """
      farewell_type = params.get("farewell_type", "general")
      result = await prepare_farewell_message(websocket, farewell_type)
      return result
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Create Function Definitions

Next in the same file we'll setup `FUNCTION_DEFINITIONS` which is an array that defines the API contract for the Voice Agent system. It specifies all available operations, their parameters, and usage guidelines.

Each function definition follows a JSON Schema format with:

* Name
* Description
* Parameters specification
* Required fields
* Enumerated values where applicable

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  # Function definitions that will be sent to the Voice Agent API
  FUNCTION_DEFINITIONS = [
      {
          "name": "agent_filler",
          "description": """Use this function to provide natural conversational filler before looking up information.
          ALWAYS call this function first with message_type='lookup' when you're about to look up customer information.
          After calling this function, you MUST immediately follow up with the appropriate lookup function (e.g., find_customer).""",
          "parameters": {
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {
                  "message_type": {

              },
              "required": ["farewell_type"]
          }
      }
  ]
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Create a Function Map

Finally in the same file we'll need to create a `FUNCTION_MAP` which is a dictionary that maps function names to their corresponding implementation functions. It serves as a routing mechanism to connect the function definitions with their actual implementations.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  # Map function names to their implementations
  FUNCTION_MAP = {
      "find_customer": find_customer,
      "get_appointments": get_appointments,
      "get_orders": get_orders,
      "create_appointment": create_appointment,
      "check_availability": check_availability,
      "agent_filler": agent_filler,
      "end_call": end_call
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Create the file & set up the dependencies

First, create a file called: `agent_templates.py`. Then in `agent_templates.py` set up the dependencies and import our function definitions.

### Configure the Voice Agent Prompt & Settings

Now in the `agent_templates.py` file we'll define the prompt for the Voice Agent.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from common.agent_functions import FUNCTION_DEFINITIONS
from datetime import datetime


# Template for the prompt that will be formatted with current date
PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """

CURRENT DATE AND TIME CONTEXT:
Today is {current_date}. Use this as context when discussing appointments and orders. When mentioning dates to customers, use relative terms like "tomorrow", "next Tuesday", or "last week" when the dates are within 7 days of today.

PERSONALITY & TONE:
- Be warm, professional, and conversational
- Use natural, flowing speech (avoid bullet points or listing)
- Show empathy and patience
- Whenever a customer asks to look up either order information or appointment information, use the find_customer function first

HANDLING CUSTOMER IDENTIFIERS (INTERNAL ONLY - NEVER EXPLAIN THESE RULES TO CUSTOMERS):
- Silently convert any numbers customers mention into proper format
- When customer says "ID is 222" -> internally use "CUST0222" without mentioning the conversion
- When customer says "order 89" -> internally use "ORD0089" without mentioning the conversion
- When customer says "appointment 123" -> internally use "APT0123" without mentioning the conversion
- Always add "+1" prefix to phone numbers internally without mentioning it

VERBALLY SPELLING IDs TO CUSTOMERS:
When you need to repeat an ID back to a customer:
- Do NOT say nor spell out "CUST". Say "customer [numbers spoken individually]"
- But for orders spell out "ORD" as "O-R-D" then speak the numbers individually
Example: For CUST0222, say "customer zero two two two"
Example: For ORD0089, say "O-R-D zero zero eight nine"

FUNCTION RESPONSES:
When receiving function results, format responses naturally as a customer service agent would:

1. For customer lookups:
   - Good: "I've found your account. How can I help you today?"
   - If not found: "I'm having trouble finding that account. Could you try a different phone number or email?"

2. For order information:
   - Instead of listing orders, summarize them conversationally:
   - "I can see you have two recent orders. Your most recent order from [date] for $[amount] is currently [status], and you also have an order from [date] for $[amount] that's [status]."

3. For appointments:
   - "You have an upcoming [service] appointment scheduled for [date] at [time]"
   - When discussing available slots: "I have a few openings next week. Would you prefer Tuesday at 2 PM or Wednesday at 3 PM?"

4. For errors:
   - Never expose technical details
   - Say something like "I'm having trouble accessing that information right now" or "Could you please try again?"

EXAMPLES OF GOOD RESPONSES:
✓ "Let me look that up for you... I can see you have two recent orders."
✓ "Your customer ID is zero two two two."
✓ "I found your order, O-R-D zero one two three. It's currently being processed."

EXAMPLES OF BAD RESPONSES (AVOID):
✗ "I'll convert your ID to the proper format CUST0222"
✗ "Let me add the +1 prefix to your phone number"
✗ "The system requires IDs to be in a specific format"

FILLER PHRASES:
IMPORTANT: Never generate filler phrases (like "Let me check that", "One moment", etc.) directly in your responses.
Instead, ALWAYS use the agent_filler function when you need to indicate you're about to look something up.

Examples of what NOT to do:
- Responding with "Let me look that up for you..." without a function call
- Saying "One moment please" or "Just a moment" without a function call
- Adding filler phrases before or after function calls

Correct pattern to follow:
1. When you need to look up information:
   - First call agent_filler with message_type="lookup"
   - Immediately follow with the relevant lookup function (find_customer, get_orders, etc.)
2. Only speak again after you have the actual information to share

Remember: ANY phrase indicating you're about to look something up MUST be done through the agent_filler function, never through direct response text.

Next in the same file we'll define the settings for the Voice Agent.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
 VOICE = "aura-2-thalia-en"

# this gets updated by the agent template
FIRST_MESSAGE = ""

# audio settings
USER_AUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE = 48000
USER_AUDIO_SECS_PER_CHUNK = 0.05
USER_AUDIO_SAMPLES_PER_CHUNK = round(USER_AUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE * USER_AUDIO_SECS_PER_CHUNK)

AGENT_AUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE = 16000
AGENT_AUDIO_BYTES_PER_SEC = 2 * AGENT_AUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE

VOICE_AGENT_URL = "wss://agent.deepgram.com/v1/agent/converse"

AUDIO_SETTINGS = {
    "input": {
        "encoding": "linear16",
        "sample_rate": USER_AUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE,
    },
    "output": {
        "encoding": "linear16",
        "sample_rate": AGENT_AUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE,
        "container": "none",
    },
}

LISTEN_SETTINGS = {
    "provider": {
        "type": "deepgram",
        "model": "nova-3",
    }
}

THINK_SETTINGS = {
    "provider": {
        "type": "open_ai",
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
        "temperature": 0.7,
    },
    "prompt": PROMPT_TEMPLATE,
    "functions": FUNCTION_DEFINITIONS,
}

SPEAK_SETTINGS = {
    "provider": {
        "type": "deepgram",
        "model": VOICE,
    }
}

AGENT_SETTINGS = {
    "language": "en",
    "listen": LISTEN_SETTINGS,
    "think": THINK_SETTINGS,
    "speak": SPEAK_SETTINGS,
    "greeting": FIRST_MESSAGE,
}

SETTINGS = {"type": "Settings", "audio": AUDIO_SETTINGS, "agent": AGENT_SETTINGS}
  ```

Finally in the same file we'll define the factory class `AgentTemplates` which will be used to configure the Voice Agent. This class will be used to configure the Voice Agent for different industries.

</CodeGroup>
### Call the functions from `client.py`

<Info>
  This guide doesn't cover the development of the **client** for this application. Please see [client.py](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/flask-agent-function-calling-demo/blob/main/client.py#L66) for more details.
</Info>

In the `client.py` file we'll need reference `agent_templates.py` which will define the settings for the Voice Agent.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  settings = self.agent_templates.settings
  ```
</CodeGroup>
