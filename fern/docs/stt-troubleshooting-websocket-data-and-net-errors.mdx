When working with Deepgram's Speech To Text Streaming API, you may encounter WebSocket errors. This troubleshooting guide helps you quickly identify and resolve the most common issues.

## WebSocket Basics

- WebSocket enables two-way, real-time communication between client and server.
- The connection is established via an HTTP handshake and upgraded to WebSocket.
- If the handshake fails, you'll get an HTTP `4xx` or `5xx` error.
- The connection stays open until closed by either side.

### Establishing a WebSocket Connection

- The client initiates a WebSocket connection with an HTTP handshake, optionally including query parameters or headers (for authentication, etc.).
- Most libraries handle the handshake automatically (e.g., `websockets.connect`).
- If successful, the server responds with HTTP `101` and upgrades the connection.
- If unsuccessful, you'll receive an HTTP `4xx` or `5xx` error and the connection won't be established.

### Closing the WebSocket Connection

- A successfully opened WebSocket connection will stay alive until it is eventually closed by either the client or the server. When this occurs, a [WebSocket Close Frame](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-5.5.1) will be returned.
- The body of the Close frame will indicate the reason for closing with a [pre-defined status code](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-7.4.1) followed by a UTF-8-encoded payload that represents the reason for the error.
- To close the WebSocket connection from your client, send a [Close Stream](/docs/close-stream) message. The server will then finish processing any remaining data, send a final response and summary metadata, and terminate the connection.
- After sending a Close message, the endpoint considers the WebSocket connection closed and will close the underlying TCP connection.

<Warning>
  Sending an empty byte (e.g., `b''`) will cause unexpected closures. Avoid sending an empty byte accidentally by adding a conditional to check if the length of your audio packet is 0 before sending.
</Warning>

## Using KeepAlive Messages to Prevent Timeouts

- Send a [KeepAlive](/docs/keep-alive) message periodically to keep the connection open.
- Doing this can prevent timeouts and NET-0001 errors (no audio received for 10 seconds).

## Common WebSocket Errors

### Failure to Connect

If a failure to connect occurs, Deepgram returns custom HTTP headers for debugging:
  - `dg-request-id`: Always present, contains the request ID.
  - `dg-error`: Present on failed upgrades, contains the error message.

<Info>
  Access to these headers will depend on the WebSocket library you are using. For example, browser-based WebSocket libraries like the JavaScript WebSocket library only allow access to HTTP header information for successful WebSocket connections.
</Info>

### Debugging Connection Failures

If you're unable to connect the Deepgram API provides custom HTTP headers that contain debugging information:

* Regardless of the success or failure of the WebSocket upgrade, all requests include the `dg-request-id` HTTP header, which contains the request ID.
* Requests that do not successfully upgrade to a WebSocket connection also include the `dg-error` HTTP header, which contains a detailed error message concerning why the connection could not be upgraded. This error message is also sent back in the body of the HTTP response.


### Code Samples

These code samples demonstrate how to connect to Deepgramâ€™s API using WebSockets, authenticate with your API key, and handle both successful and failed connection attempts by printing relevant request IDs and error messages for troubleshooting.

<Warning>
  Replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your [Deepgram API Key](/docs/create-additional-api-keys).
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  import websockets
  import json
  import asyncio

  async def main():
      try:
          async with websockets.connect('wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen',
          # Remember to replace the YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY placeholder with your Deepgram API Key
          extra_headers = { 'Authorization': f'token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' }) as ws:
              # If the request is successful, print the request ID from the HTTP header
              print('ðŸŸ¢ Successfully opened connection')
              print(f'Request ID: {ws.response_headers["dg-request-id"]}')
              await ws.send(json.dumps({
                  'type': 'CloseStream'
              }))
      except websockets.exceptions.InvalidStatusCode as e:
          # If the request fails, print both the error message and the request ID from the HTTP headers
          print(f'ðŸ”´ ERROR: Could not connect to Deepgram! {e.headers.get("dg-error")}')
          print(f'ðŸ”´ Please contact Deepgram Support with request ID {e.headers.get("dg-request-id")}')

  asyncio.run(main())
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript
  const WebSocket = require('ws');
  const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen', {
      headers: {
        // Remember to replace the YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY placeholder with your Deepgram API Key
        Authorization: 'Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY',
      },
  });
  // For security reasons, browser-based WebSocket libraries only allow access to HTTP header information for successful WebSocket connections
  // If the request is successful, return the HTTP header that contains the request ID
  ws.on('upgrade', function message(data) {
      console.log(data.headers['dg-request-id']);
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Abrupt WebSocket Closures

If Deepgram encounters an error during real-time streaming, the Deepgram API returns a [WebSocket Close frame](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455#section-5.5.1). The body of the Close frame will indicate the reason for closing with a [pre-defined status code](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-7.4.1) followed by a UTF-8-encoded payload that represents the reason for the error.

Below are the most common WebSocket Close frame status codes and their descriptions.


| Code   | Payload     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1008` | `DATA-0000` | The payload cannot be decoded as audio. The payload either is not audio data or is a codec unsupported by Deepgram.                                                                                                           |
| `1011` | `NET-0000`  | The service has not transmitted a Text frame to the client within the timeout window. This may indicate an internal issue with Deepgram's systems, or Deepgram may have not received enough audio data to transcribe a frame. |
| `1011` | `NET-0001`  | The service has not received a Binary or Text frame from the client within the timeout window. This may indicate an internal issue with Deepgram's systems, the client's systems, or the network connecting them.             |

#### Troubleshooting `1008` - `DATA-0000`

- Check the data being sent is valid audio.
- Check the audio data is not empty.
- If the audio data is valid, check whether the audio being sent is raw or containerized.
- Write the audio data to a file to make sure it contains the expected audio and can be played back.
- Ensure [Encoding](/docs/encoding) and [Sample Rate](/docs/sample-rate) parameters are set correctly.
- See [Audio Format For Live Streaming](/docs/determining-your-audio-format-for-live-streaming-audio) for more information.


#### Troubleshooting `1011` - `NET-0000`
- This indicates an internal server error.
- Retry your request.
- Check [Deepgram status](https://status.deepgram.com/) to see if there are any ongoing issues.
- If Deepgram is operational, [contact Support](/docs/support ) for assistance.

#### Troubleshooting `1011` - `NET-0001`

- Ensure audio is sent within 10 seconds of opening the connection.
- You can send silent audio to keep the connection alive.
- Using `KeepAlive` messages alone will not prevent closure; you must send at least one audio message.
- Be sure to send a [Close Stream](/docs/close-stream) message when done.
- Test your network with cURL and Deepgram-hosted audio. See [Generating Transcripts from the Terminal](/docs/generating-and-saving-transcripts-from-the-terminal) for more information.
- Use a tool like [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) to confirm audio is leaving your network.
