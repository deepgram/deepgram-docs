`KeepAlive` serves as a crucial mechanism for maintaining an uninterrupted connection with Deepgram's servers, allowing you to optimize your audio streaming experience while minimizing costs.

# What is the`KeepAlive` message?

A common situation is needing to keep a connection open without constantly sending audio. Normally, you'd have to send data all the time, even silence, which wastes resources and increases costs since Deepgram charges for all audio, whether itâ€™s speech or silence. `KeepAlive` solves this by allowing you to pause the connection and resume later, avoiding extra costs for transcribing silence.

## Benefits

* **Cost Efficiency**: `KeepAlive` enables you to optimize costs by pausing the connection during periods of silence, eliminating the need to transcribe unnecessary audio data.
* **Connection Maintenance**: By sending periodic `KeepAlive` messages, you can ensure that the WebSocket connection remains open, preventing timeouts and maintaining communication with Deepgram's servers.
* **Flexibility**: `KeepAlive` offers flexibility in managing your streaming sessions. You can temporarily halt the transmission of audio data while keeping the connection active, resuming data streaming when needed without re-establishing the connection.

## Sending `KeepAlive`

To send the` KeepAlive` message, you need to send the following JSON message to the server:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
    "type": "KeepAlive" 
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Because Deepgram's streaming connection is set to time out after 10 seconds of inactivity, it's essential to periodically send `KeepAlive` messages to maintain the connection and prevent it from closing prematurely.

If no audio data is sent within a 10-second window, the connection will close, triggering a `NET-0001` error. Using `KeepAlive` extends the connection by another 10 seconds. To avoid this error and keep the connection open, continue sending `KeepAlive` messages 3-5 seconds before the 10 second timeout window expires until you are ready to resume sending audio.

<Info>
  Be sure to send the KeepAlive message as a text WebSocket message. Sending it as a binary message may result in incorrect handling and could lead to connection issues.
</Info>

## `KeepAlive` Confirmation

You will not receive a response back from the server.

## Language Specific Implementations

Following are code examples to help you get started.

### Sending a `KeepAlive` message in JSON Format

These snippets demonstrate how to construct a JSON message containing the `KeepAlive` type and send it over the WebSocket connection in each respective language.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript JavaScript
  const WebSocket = require("ws");

  // Assuming 'headers' is already defined for authorization
  const ws = new WebSocket("wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen", { headers });

  // Assuming 'ws' is the WebSocket connection object
  const keepAliveMsg = JSON.stringify({ type: "KeepAlive" });
  ws.send(keepAliveMsg);
  ```

  ```python Python
  import json
  import websocket

  # Assuming 'headers' is already defined for authorization
  ws = websocket.create_connection("wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen", header=headers)

  # Assuming 'ws' is the WebSocket connection object
  keep_alive_msg = json.dumps({"type": "KeepAlive"})
  ws.send(keep_alive_msg)
  ```

  ```go Go
  package main

  import (
      "encoding/json"
      "log"
      "net/http"
      "github.com/gorilla/websocket"
  )

  func main() {
      // Define headers for authorization
      headers := http.Header{}
      
    	// Assuming headers are set here for authorization
      conn, _, err := websocket.DefaultDialer.Dial("wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen", headers)
      if err != nil {
          log.Fatal("Error connecting to WebSocket:", err)
      }
      defer conn.Close()

      // Construct KeepAlive message
      keepAliveMsg := map[string]string{"type": "KeepAlive"}
      jsonMsg, err := json.Marshal(keepAliveMsg)
      if err != nil {
          log.Fatal("Error encoding JSON:", err)
      }

      // Send KeepAlive message
      err = conn.WriteMessage(websocket.TextMessage, jsonMsg)
      if err != nil {
          log.Fatal("Error sending KeepAlive message:", err)
      }
  }
  ```

  ```csharp C#
  using System;
  using System.Net.WebSockets;
  using System.Text;
  using System.Threading;
  using System.Threading.Tasks;

  class Program
  {
      static async Task Main(string[] args)
      {
          // Set up the WebSocket URL and headers
          Uri uri = new Uri("wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen");
          
          string apiKey = "DEEPGRAM_API_KEY";

          // Create a new client WebSocket instance
          using (ClientWebSocket ws = new ClientWebSocket())
          {
              // Set the authorization header
              ws.Options.SetRequestHeader("Authorization", "Token " + apiKey);

              // Connect to the WebSocket server
              await ws.ConnectAsync(uri, CancellationToken.None);

              // Construct the KeepAlive message
              string keepAliveMsg = "{\"type\": \"KeepAlive\"}";

              // Convert the KeepAlive message to a byte array
              byte[] keepAliveBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(keepAliveMsg);

              // Send the KeepAlive message asynchronously
              await ws.SendAsync(new ArraySegment<byte>(keepAliveBytes), WebSocketMessageType.Text, true, CancellationToken.None);
          }
      }
  }
  ```

### Streaming Examples

Here are more complete examples that make a streaming request and use `KeepAlive`. Try running these examples to see how `KeepAlive` is sent periodically.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript JavaScript
  const WebSocket = require("ws");

  const authToken = "DEEPGRAM_API_KEY"; // Replace 'DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' with your actual authorization token
  const headers = {
    Authorization: `Token ${authToken}`,
  };

  // Initialize WebSocket connection
  const ws = new WebSocket("wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen", { headers });

  // Handle WebSocket connection open event
  ws.on("open", function open() {
    console.log("WebSocket connection established.");

    // Send audio data (replace this with your audio streaming logic)
    // Example: Read audio from a microphone and send it over the WebSocket
    // For demonstration purposes, we're just sending a KeepAlive message

    setInterval(() => {
      const keepAliveMsg = JSON.stringify({ type: "KeepAlive" });
      ws.send(keepAliveMsg);
      console.log("Sent KeepAlive message");
    }, 3000); // Sending KeepAlive messages every 3 seconds
  });

  // Handle WebSocket message event
  ws.on("message", function incoming(data) {
    console.log("Received:", data);
    // Handle received data (transcription results, errors, etc.)
  });

  // Handle WebSocket close event
  ws.on("close", function close() {
    console.log("WebSocket connection closed.");
  });

  // Handle WebSocket error event
  ws.on("error", function error(err) {
    console.error("WebSocket error:", err.message);
  });

  // Gracefully close the WebSocket connection when done
  function closeWebSocket() {
    const closeMsg = JSON.stringify({ type: "CloseStream" });
    ws.send(closeMsg);
  }

  // Call closeWebSocket function when you're finished streaming audio
  // For example, when user stops recording or when the application exits
  // closeWebSocket();
  ```

  ```python Python
  import websocket
  import json
  import time
  import threading

  auth_token = "DEEPGRAM_API_KEY"  # Replace 'DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' with your actual authorization token
  headers = {
      "Authorization": f"Token {auth_token}"
  }

  # WebSocket URL
  ws_url = "wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen"

  # Define the WebSocket on_open function
  def on_open(ws):
      print("WebSocket connection established.")
      # Send KeepAlive messages every 3 seconds
      def keep_alive():
          while True:
              keep_alive_msg = json.dumps({"type": "KeepAlive"})
              ws.send(keep_alive_msg)
              print("Sent KeepAlive message")
              time.sleep(3)
      # Start a thread for sending KeepAlive messages
      keep_alive_thread = threading.Thread(target=keep_alive)
      keep_alive_thread.daemon = True
      keep_alive_thread.start()

  # Define the WebSocket on_message function
  def on_message(ws, message):
      print("Received:", message)
      # Handle received data (transcription results, errors, etc.)

  # Define the WebSocket on_close function
  def on_close(ws):
      print("WebSocket connection closed.")

  # Define the WebSocket on_error function
  def on_error(ws, error):
      print("WebSocket error:", error)

  # Create WebSocket connection
  ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(ws_url,
                              on_open=on_open,
                              on_message=on_message,
                              on_close=on_close,
                              on_error=on_error,
                              header=headers)

  # Run the WebSocket
  ws.run_forever()

## Deepgram SDKs

Deepgram's SDKs make it easier to build with Deepgram in your preferred language. To learn more about getting started with the SDKs, visit Deepgram's [SDKs documentation.](/docs/deepgram-sdks)

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript JavaScript
  const { createClient, LiveTranscriptionEvents } = require("@deepgram/sdk");

  const live = async () => {
    const deepgram = createClient("DEEPGRAM_API_KEY");
    let connection;
    let keepAlive;

    const setupDeepgram = () => {
      connection = deepgram.listen.live({
        model: "nova-3",
        utterance_end_ms: 1500,
        interim_results: true,
      });

      if (keepAlive) clearInterval(keepAlive);
      keepAlive = setInterval(() => {
        console.log("KeepAlive sent.");
        connection.keepAlive();
      }, 3000); // Sending KeepAlive messages every 3 seconds

      connection.on(LiveTranscriptionEvents.Open, () => {
        console.log("Connection opened.");
      });

      connection.on(LiveTranscriptionEvents.Close, () => {

## Word Timings

Word timings for transcription results returned from a stream are based on the audio sent, not the lifetime of the websocket. If you send `KeepAlive` messages without sending audio payloads for a period of time, then resume sending audio payloads, the timestamps for transcription results will pick up where they left off when you paused sending audio payloads.

Here is an example timeline demonstrating the behavior:

| Event                                                            | Wall Time  | Word Timing Range on Results Response |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Websocket opened, begin sending audio payloads                   | 0 seconds  | 0 seconds                             |
| Results received                                                 | 5 seconds  | 0-5 seconds                           |
| Results received                                                 | 10 seconds | 5-10 seconds                          |
| Pause sending audio payloads, while sending `KeepAlive` messages | 10 seconds | *n/a*                                 |
| Resume sending audio payloads                                    | 30 seconds | *n/a*                                 |
| Results received                                                 | 35 seconds | 10-15 seconds                         |
