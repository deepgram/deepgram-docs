title: Pre-Recorded Audio Transcription
subtitle: An overview of the Deepgram .NET SDK and Deepgram speech-to-text pre-recorded.
slug: docs/dotnet-sdk-pre-recorded-transcription
---


The `.NET SDK` implements a PreRecordedClient at the root of the `Deepgram` namespace that allows you to request transcripts for pre-recorded audio. To request a transcript for a pre-recorded particular audio file, you'll use the `TranscribeUrl` or `TranscribeFile` methods.

## Installing the SDK

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp C#
  # Install the Deepgram .NET SDK
  # https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-dotnet-sdk

  dotnet add package Deepgram

  # Optionally, install the Deepgram Microphone package
  dotnet add package Deepgram.Microphone
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Transcription Sources

Two types of sources can be provided for transcription:

### UrlSource

Provides a URL to the file to transcribe.

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp C#
  // Set "DEEPGRAM_API_KEY" environment variable to your Deepgram API Key
  var deepgramClient = ClientFactory.CreateListenRESTClient();

  var response = await deepgramClient.TranscribeUrl(
    new UrlSource("https://static.deepgram.com/examples/Bueller-Life-moves-pretty-fast.wav"),
    new PreRecordedSchema()
    {
      Model = "nova-3",
    });

  Console.WriteLine(response);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### StreamSource

Provide a stream containing the file to transcribe.

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp C#
  // Set "DEEPGRAM_API_KEY" environment variable to your Deepgram API Key
  var deepgramClient = ClientFactory.CreateListenRESTClient();

  var audioData = File.ReadAllBytes(@"Bueller-Life-moves-pretty-fast.wav");
  var response = await deepgramClient.TranscribeFile(
    audioData,
    new PreRecordedSchema()
    {
      Model = "nova-3",
      Punctuate = true,
    });

  Console.WriteLine(response);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### HTTP Client Timeout

For larger files, you might need to increase the default HTTP Timeout setting set to 30 seconds by default.

For `TranscribeUrl`, that would look like:

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp C#
  # 10 minute timeout: 600,000ms = 10mins
  CancellationTokenSource cancelToken = new CancellationTokenSource(600000);

  var response = await deepgramClient.TranscribeUrl(
    new UrlSource("https://static.deepgram.com/examples/Bueller-Life-moves-pretty-fast.wav"),
    new PreRecordedSchema()
    {
      Model = "nova-3",
    },
  	cancelToken);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

For `TranscribeFile`, that would look like:

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp C#
  # 10 minute timeout: 600,000ms = 10mins
  CancellationTokenSource cancelToken = new CancellationTokenSource(600000);

  var audioData = File.ReadAllBytes(@"Bueller-Life-moves-pretty-fast.wav");
  var response = await deepgramClient.TranscribeFile(
    audioData,
    new PreRecordedSchema()
    {
      Model = "nova-3",
      Punctuate = true,
    },
  	cancelToken);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Increasing the Timeout for Processing Larger Files

For larger files, you might need to increase the default HTTP Timeout setting, which is 300 seconds (or 5 mins).

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp C#
  var deepgram = new DeepgramClient(credentials);
  deepgram.SetHttpClientTimeout(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(300)); // 300 = 5 mins
  ```
</CodeGroup>
