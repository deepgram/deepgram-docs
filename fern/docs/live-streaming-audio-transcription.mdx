title: Live Streaming Audio Transcription
subtitle: >-
  The Deepgram  has a  package that allows you to request transcripts for
  real-time streaming audio. To request a transcript for a live streaming audio,
  you'll use one of the following functions depending on your audio source:
slug: docs/live-streaming-audio-transcription

## Live Transcription Parameters

The input parameters for Live/Streaming transcription consist of two parts:

* What options do you want to transcribe the live audio stream
* Obtaining notifications for transcription events

| Parameter | Type    | Description                                                          |
| --------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ctx       | Context | Go Context                                                           |
| options   | Object  | Parameters to filter requests. See below.                            |
| callback  | Object  | Provides asynchronous event notifications from the Deepgram Platform |

Options are provided via the [LiveTranscriptionOptions struct](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/pkg/client/interfaces/v1/types-stream.go#L14) to be provided in the [`NewWebSocket`](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/pkg/client/listen/client.go#L130) function. Each of these parameters maps to a feature in the Deepgram API. Reference the [features documentation](/docs/features-overview) to learn the appropriate features for your request.

The [Callback Interface](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/pkg/api/listen/v1/websocket/interfaces/interfaces.go#L9-L18) defines what you want to do with the transcription as it happens in real-time. You can receive notifications of two events: Message/Transcriptions and Metadata.

### Initiating a Connection

Creating a Live Client can be done by using the following code:

<CodeGroup>
  ```go Go
  // options
  transcriptOptions := interfaces.LiveTranscriptionOptions{
  	Language:    "en-US",
  	Punctuate:   true,
  	Encoding:    "linear16",
  	Channels:    1,
  	Sample_rate: 16000,
  }

  // create a callback for transcription messages
  // for example, you can take a look at this example project:
  // https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/streaming/microphone/main.go

  // create the client
  dgClient, err := client.NewWebSocketWithDefaults(ctx, transcriptOptions, callback)
  if err != nil {
  	log.Println("ERROR creating LiveTranscription connection:", err)
  	return
  }

  // call connect!
  bConencted := dgClient.Connect()
  if !bConencted {
  	log.Println("Client.Connect failed")
  	os.Exit(1)
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Define Options for the Client

`ClientOptions` defines any options for the client. When creating a new Deepgram `LiveTranscription` client, pass in the optional config options.

A common config option would be to enable the KeepAlive option with `EnableKeepAlive`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```go Go
  ctx := context.Background()
  	apiKey := "DEEPGRAM_API_KEY"
  	clientOptions := interfaces.ClientOptions{
  		EnableKeepAlive: true, // Enable KeepAlive option
  	}

  	transcriptOptions := interfaces.LiveTranscriptionOptions{
  		Language:    "en-US",
  		Model:       "nova-3",
  		SmartFormat: true,
  	}

  	// Implement your own callback
  	callback := MyCallback{}

  	// Create a new Deepgram LiveTranscription client with config options
  	dgClient, err := client.NewWebSocket(ctx, apiKey, clientOptions, transcriptOptions, callback)
  	if err != nil {
  		fmt.Println("ERROR creating LiveTranscription connection:", err)
  		return
  	}
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Events

The live transcription client fires the following events:

| Event      | Description                                                              | Data                                                                                                                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Message`  | Transcription event - contains transcribed audio                         | [MessageResponse](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/pkg/api/listen/v1/websocket/interfaces/types.go#L89-L99)    |
| `Metadata` | Metadata event - these are usually information describing the connection | [MetadataResponse](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/pkg/api/listen/v1/websocket/interfaces/types.go#L102-L113) |

### Implementing an Event Callback Listener

To receive transcription events, the [LiveMessageCallback interface](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/pkg/api/listen/v1/websocket/interfaces/interfaces.go#L9-L18) needs to be implemented as defined below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```go Go
  // LiveMessageCallback is a callback used to receive notifcations for platforms messages
  type LiveMessageCallback interface {
  	Open(or *OpenResponse) error
  	Message(mr *MessageResponse) error
  	Metadata(md *MetadataResponse) error
  	SpeechStarted(ssr *SpeechStartedResponse) error
  	UtteranceEnd(ur *UtteranceEndResponse) error
  	Close(cr *CloseResponse) error
  	Error(er *ErrorResponse) error
  	UnhandledEvent(byData []byte) error
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Sending Data/Streams

Go is a very stream-oriented language. Many helpful interfaces are provided natively and, if utilized correctly, dramatically simplify the implementation of your client. The Live Client implements the [io.Writer interface](https://pkg.go.dev/io#Writer), which means one can read data from your audio source and push it into the [Deepgram Client](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/pkg/client/listen/v1/websocket/client.go#L444).

What this ends up looking like on the client side is:

<CodeGroup>
  ```js Go
  	go func() {
  		// this is a blocking call
  		mic.Stream(dgClient)
  	}()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Closing the Connection

When finished with the Live stream, you can safely close the stream by calling the following function on the client.

<CodeGroup>
  ```js js
  deepgramLive.finish();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Where To Find Additional Examples

The repository has a good collection of live audio transcription examples. You can find links to them in the [README](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#examples) attempts to provide different options for trancribing. Each example below will attempt to provide different options on how you might transcribe a live-streaming source.

* From a Microphone - [examples/streaming/microphone](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/speech-to-text/websocket/microphone/README.md)
* From a HTTP Endpoint - [examples/streaming/http](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/streaming/http/main.go)
