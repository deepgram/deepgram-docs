subtitle: Errors you might encounter when making requests to the Deepgram API
---

A record of errors and reasons you will receive them when using the Deepgram API.

## General API errors

Errors that could be returned on any endpoint.

### `400` Invalid JSON submitted

When making a `POST` request with JSON data, you must include all required fields. If required filed are missing, or the submitted JSON is invalid, a `400 Bad Request` will be returned. The response will be similar to the below, depending on the endpoint and how the JSON is malformed.

```json
{
  "category": "INVALID_JSON",
  "message": "Invalid JSON submitted.",
  "details": "Json deserialize error: missing field `xxx` at line 7 column 1",
  "request_id": "uuid"
}
---
{
  "err_code": "Bad Request",
  "err_msg": "Content-type was application/json, but we could not process the JSON payload.",
  "request_id": "uuid"
}
---
{
  "category": "INVALID_JSON",
  "message": "Invalid JSON submitted.",
  "details": "Json deserialize error: expected `:` at line 3 column 13",
  "request_id": "uuid"
}
```

### `400` Unknown request body format

If you receive the following error:

```json
{
  "err_code": "Bad Request",
  "err_msg": "Bad Request: failed to process audio: corrupt or unsupported data",
  "request_id": "uuid"
}
```

Often, this is caused by sending Deepgram a URL to transcribe, but failing to set a `Content-Type: application/json` header. When sending Deepgram a JSON payload containing a URL, the `Content-Type: application/json` must be set in the request.

If you are sending an audio file and not a URL, you may be sending corrupted audio. You can use tools such as `ffprobe` or Audacity to confirm that your audio file is valid.

### `401` Incorrect API key

Providing an invalid API key will return `401 Unauthorized` with the following error.

```json
{
  "err_code": "INVALID_AUTH",
  "err_msg": "Invalid credentials.",
  "request_id": "uuid"
}
```

### `401` Insufficient permissions

Making a request that you do not have sufficient permissions for will return `401 Unauthorized` with this error.

```json
{
 "err_code":"INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS",
 "err_msg":"User does not have sufficient permissions.",
 "request_id":"uuid"
}
```

### `403` Insufficient permissions

Making a request for a model that you do not have access to will return `403 Forbidden` with this error.

```json
{
 "err_code":"INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS",
 "err_msg":"Project does not have access to the requested model.",
 "request_id":"uuid"
}
```

### `404` UUID parsing failed

Providing an invalid Project ID will fail parsing and return `404 Not Found` and this response.

```text
UUID parsing failed: invalid character: expected an optional prefix of `urn:uuid:` followed by [0-9a-zA-Z], found `p` at 1
```

### `404` Project not found

When a project isn't found it will result in `404 Not Found`. It may be because;

- the Project ID is incorrect
- the Project ID is for a project that has been deleted
- the Project ID is not associated with the API key used to make the request

```json
{
  "err_code": "PROJECT_NOT_FOUND",
  "err_msg": "Project not found."
}
```

## Speech to Text errors

### `402` Insufficient credits

When attempting to transcribe a file, you may not have sufficient funds to complete the request. This will result in a `402 Payment Required` error with this error.

```json
{
  "err_code": "ASR_PAYMENT_REQUIRED",
  "err_msg": "Project does not have enough credits for an ASR request and does not have an overage agreement.",
  "request_id": "uuid"
}
```

### `429` Rate limit exceeded

When requests are made in excess of Deepgram's [rate limits](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/getting-started-with-pre-recorded-audio#rate-limits), a `429 Too Many Requests` is returned with the following error. An [exponential-backoff retry strategy](https://deepgram.com/learn/api-back-off-strategies) is recommended to accommodate rate-limiting when submitting a large volume of concurrent requests.

```json json
{
  "err_code": "TOO_MANY_REQUESTS",
  "err_msg": "Too many requests. Please try again later",
  "request_id": "uuid"
}
```

## Text to Speech Errors

### `400`Unknown Model. Query parameters specify a model that does not exist.

The model requested is not one of Deepgram's [voice models](/docs/tts-models).

```json
{
  "err_code": "Bad Request",
  "err_msg": "Bad Request: No such model/version combination found.",
  "request_id": "[unique_request_id]"
}
```

### `400` Failure to Parse Query Parameters

The query parameters were invalid. The `message` can be anything describing a failure to parse an invalid query string.

```json
{
  "err_code": "INVALID_QUERY_PARAMETER",
  "err_msg": "Failed to deserialize query parameters: [message]",
  "request_id": "[unique_request_id]"
}
```

### `400` Input Text Contained No Characters

The text payload contained no characters, resulting in Deepgram being unable to synthesize text into audio.

```json
{
  "err_code": "Bad Request",
  "err_msg": "Input text contains no characters.",
  "request_id": "[unique_request_id]"
}
```

### `400` Unsupported Output Audio Format Requested in Query Parameters

The request provides a query string containing any combination of query parameters that describes an unsupported output audio format.

```json
{
  "err_code": "INVALID_QUERY_PARAMETER",
  "err_msg": "Unsupported audio format: [message]",
  "request_id": "[unique_request_id]"
}
```

One or more of the following query parameters is unsupported:

- `encoding=[encoding]`
- `container=[container]`
- `sample_rate=[sample_rate]`
- `bit_rate=[bit_rate]`

`message` may be any one of:

- "`container` is not applicable when `encoding=[encoding]`"
- "`container=[container]` is invalid when `encoding=[encoding]`"
- "`sample_rate` is not applicable when `encoding=[encoding]`"
- "`sample_rate` must be [list of valid sample rates] when `encoding=[encoding]`"
- "`bit_rate` is not applicable when `encoding=[encoding]`"
- "`bit_rate` must be [list of valid bit rates] when `encoding=[encoding]`"

### `400` Failure to Parse Request Body as JSON

The request body did not deserialize as JSON successfully. The request body must specify exactly one of `text` or `url` in the body.

```json
{
  "err_code": "PAYLOAD_ERROR",
  "err_msg": "Failed to deserialize JSON payload. Please specify exactly one of `text` or `url` in the JSON body.",
  "request_id": "[unique_request_id]"
}
```

### `400` Failure to Parse Remote Text URL Provide in JSON

There was a failure to parse a remote text URL provided within the JSON body.

```json
{
  "err_code": "PAYLOAD_ERROR",
  "err_msg": "Failed to parse URL in JSON body.",
  "request_id": "[unique_request_id]"
}
```

### `400` Failure to Fetch Remote Text from URL

There was a failure to retrieve remote text content from the specified URL.

```json
{
  "err_code": "REMOTE_CONTENT_ERROR",
  "err_msg": "[message]",
  "request_id": "[unique_request_id]"
}
```

`message` may be any of:

- "Failed to deserialize remote text data. Please provide `application/json` with a `text` field or `text/plain`."
- "URL for media download must be publicly routable."
- "Could not determine if URL for media download is publicly routable."
- "Could not parse URL as a URI."
- "The remote server hosting the media failed to include a `location` header in its redirect response."
- "Could not parse remote media server's redirect location as a valid UTF-8 string."
- "Could not parse remote media server's redirect location as a URL."
- "The remote server hosting the media returned a client error: [HTTP status]."
- "The remote server hosting the media failed to return valid data."
- "The remote server hosting the media returned too many redirects."

### `400` Invalid Callback

The provided callback url was invalid.

```json
{
  "err_code": "INVALID_QUERY_PARAMETER",
  "err_msg": "Invalid callback url.",
  "request_id": "[unique_request_id]"
}
```

### `413` Request Body Exceeded 2MB

The request body exceeded the 2MB limit, indicating that the payload size is too large to be processed.

```json
{
  "err_code": "PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE",
  "err_msg": "Payload size exceeds limit of 2 MB.",
  "request_id": "[unique_request_id]"
}
```

### `413` Input Text Exceeded Character Limit

The text payload contained more than 2000 characters, which is above the character limit for text-to-speech request.

```json
{
  "err_code": "Payload Too Large",
  "err_msg": "Input text exceeds maximum character limit of 2000.",
  "request_id": "[unique_request_id]"
}
```

### `400` Failure to Decode Request Body as UTF-8

The payload cannot be decoded because it is not encoded as UTF-8.

```json
{
  "err_code": "PAYLOAD_ERROR",
  "err_msg": "Failed to decode payload as UTF-8.",
  "request_id": "[unique_request_id]"
}
```

### `415` Unsupported Content Type in Request

The `Content-Type` header in the request is not supported, requiring it to be either `text/plain` or `application/json`.

```json
{
  "err_code": "UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE",
  "err_msg": "`Content-Type` header is not supported. `Content-Type` must be either `text/plain` or `application/json`.",
  "request_id": "[unique_request_id]"
}
```

### `429` Rate Limit Exceeded

When requests are made in excess of Deepgram's rate limits.

```json
{
  "err_code": "Too Many Requests",
  "err_msg": "Please try again later.",
  "request_id": "[unique_request_id]"
}
```

### `503` Service Unavailable

```json

{ 
  "error_code":"Service Unavailable",
  "err_msg": "Please try again later",
  "request_id": "[unique_request_id]"
}  
```

## Handling HTTP Errors

### Production

Some error codes, such as `400: Bad Request` errors, can be prevented in your production code by careful testing and development. However, others, such as `503: Service Unavailable`, can occur regardless of your implementation.

Below is a list of HTTP error codes that your production code should handle gracefully. Some of these errors may succeed if retried, while others (such as `414: URI Too Long`) need to be handled by modifying the request.

- **408 Request Timeout**: The server timed out waiting for the request.
- **411 Length Required**: The server refuses to accept the request without a defined Content-Length.
- **413 Request Entity Too Large**: The request is larger than the server is willing or able to process.
- **414 URI Too Long**: The server is refusing to service the request because the request-target is longer than the server is willing to interpret.
- **429 Too Many Requests**: The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time.
- **499 Client Closed Request**: A non-standard status code indicating that the client closed the connection.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: A generic error message indicating that the server has encountered a situation it doesn't know how to handle.
- **502 Bad Gateway**: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server it accessed in attempting to fulfill the request.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is not ready to handle the request. Common causes include a server that is down for maintenance or is overloaded.
- **504 Gateway Timeout**: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server or some other auxiliary server it needed to access in order to complete the request.

### Development

The following errors are more likely to be encountered in a development environment. You may want to add error handling in your production code to gracefully handle these error codes as well.

- **400 Bad Request**: The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.
- **401 Insufficient permissions**: The project does not have permissions to access the requested features or model.
- **401 Unauthorized**: The API key is invalid or unauthorized.
- **402 Payment Required**: The project has insufficient funds to complete the request.
- **403 Forbidden**: The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.
- **404 Not Found**: The specified entity ID could not be found.
