Deepgram's Smart Format feature applies additional formatting to transcripts to optimize them for human readability.

Smart Format capabilities vary between models. When Smart Format is turned on, Deepgram will always apply the best-available formatting for your chosen combination of model, model option and language.

At minimum, Smart Format applies:

* [Punctuation](/docs/punctuation/)
* [Paragraphs](/docs/paragraphs/) (for white space delineated languages, such as English or Spanish)

Smart Format has the broadest support for English-language models.

* When using the English Nova or Enhanced general models, Smart Format is capable of formatting things like dates, times, currency amounts, phone numbers, emails, and URLs.
* On other English models, Smart Format will format a smaller set of entities, including dates, times, and numbers.

On non-English models, Smart Format will apply all available formatters for that language. For the majority of languages, this is currently limited to [Punctuation](/docs/punctuation/) and [Paragraphs](/docs/paragraphs/).

## Enable Feature

To enable Smart Formatting, when you call Deepgram's API, add a `smart_format` parameter in the query string and set it to `true`:

`smart_format=true`

<Info>
  Smart Format enables Deepgram's Punctuation feature. If you've set `smart_format=true`, no need to also set `punctuate=true`.

To transcribe audio from a file on your computer, run the following cURL command in a terminal or your favorite API client.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl \
    --request POST \
    --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
    --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \
    --data-binary @youraudio.wav \
    --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?smart_format=true'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your [Deepgram API Key](/docs/create-additional-api-keys).
</Warning>

## Results

Once applied, results will appear in the transcript.

## Using No Delay

When using Smart Format with live-streamed audio, if a speaker begins saying a number, Deepgram will wait to return a transcription until the speaker has finished and continues on to non-numerical speech. This behavior ensures numbers have the best possible formatting and are not broken up over multiple chunks. To override this behavior and return results immediately, add the parameter `no_delay=true` to your streaming API request.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl \
    --request POST \
    --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
    --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \
    --data-binary @youraudio.wav \
    --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?smart_format=true&no_delay=true'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your [Deepgram API Key](/docs/create-additional-api-keys).
</Warning>
