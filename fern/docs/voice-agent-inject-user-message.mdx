The `InjectUserMessage` is a JSON message you can send to the agent to interact with the agent using text. This is useful when you need to trigger an agent response from text input.

## Purpose

The `InjectUserMessage` message provides a way to have the agent "hear" something without the user actually speaking it. The agent will respond as if the user had spoken the message.

## Example Payloads

To send the `InjectAgentMessage` message, you need to send the following JSON message to the server:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
    "type": "InjectUserMessage",
    "content": "" // The text phrase or statement the agent should listen for
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>


## Use Cases

Some common ways to use the `InjectUserMessage` are:

* A user using a chat or text interface to interact with an agent.
* Automated testing of an agent where text is used to trigger an agent response.
