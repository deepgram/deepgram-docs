The`InjectUserMessage` message is a JSON message you can send tell the agent to listen for a specific user phrase or statement.

## Purpose

The `InjectUserMessage` message provides a way to tell the agent to listen for a specific user phrase or statement. This is useful when you want to trigger an agent response based on what a user is speaking to your agent.

## Example Payloads

To send the `InjectAgentMessage` message, you need to send the following JSON message to the server:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
    "type": "InjectUserMessage",
    "content": "" // The phrase or statement the agent should listen for
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>


## Use Cases

Some common ways to use the `InjectUserMessage` are:

* A user asking the agent to repeat themselves if they didn't hear them ("I didn't catch that, can you repeat yourself?")
* A user asking the agent if they can hear them ("Can you hear me?")
* A user asking the agent to wait while they are working on something ("I'm working on that for you, just hold on a moment.")
