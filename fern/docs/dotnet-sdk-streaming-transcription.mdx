  An overview of the Deepgram .NET SDK and Deepgram speech-to-text live
  streaming.

---


The `.NET SDK` implements a LiveClient at the root of the `Deepgram` namespace. This encapsulates a websocket connection to the Deepgram API and returns a class that emits events received from the Deepgram API for consumption by your application.

## Installing the SDK

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp C#
  # Install the Deepgram .NET SDK
  # https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-dotnet-sdk

  dotnet add package Deepgram

  # Optionally, install the Deepgram Microphone package
  dotnet add package Deepgram.Microphone
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Initiating a Connection

The `Connect()` method initiates a connection with the Deepgram API via websocket. You may pass in options for the transcription as well.

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp C#
  // Set "DEEPGRAM_API_KEY" environment variable to your Deepgram API Key
  var liveClient = ClientFactory.CreateListenWebSocketClient();

  // Start the connection
  var liveSchema = new LiveSchema()
  {
    Model = "nova-3",
  };
  await liveClient.Connect(liveSchema);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Events

The following events are fired by the `LiveTranscriptionClient`:

| Event                   | Description                                           | Data                         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `OpenResponse`          | The websocket connection to Deepgram has been opened. | OpenResponse object          |
| `ResultResponse`        | Deepgram has responded with a transcription           | ResultResponse object        |
| `MetadataResponse`      | Information about the websocket connection            | MetadataResponse object      |
| `SpeechStartedResponse` | A SpeechStarted event was fired                       | SpeechStartedResponse object |
| `UtteranceEndResponse`  | An UtteranceEndResponse event was fired               | UtteranceEndResponse object  |
| `CloseResponse`         | The websocket connection to Deepgram has been closed. | CloseResponse object         |
| `ErrorResponse`         | An error was encountered                              | ErrorResponse object         |
| `UnhandledResponse`     | An unhandled response message was received            | UnhandledResponse object     |

### OpenResponse Event

Subscribe to the OpenResponse event by calling the `Subscribe()` function.

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp C#
  liveClient.Subscribe(new EventHandler<OpenResponse>((sender, e) =>
  {
  	Console.WriteLine($"\n\n----> OpenResponse received");
  }));
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### ResultResponse Event

Subscribe to the ResultResponse event by calling the `Subscribe()` function.

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp C#
  liveClient.Subscribe(new EventHandler<ResultResponse>((sender, e) =>
  {
  	Console.WriteLine($"----> Speaker: {e.Channel.Alternatives[0].Transcript}");
  }));
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### MetadataResponse Event

Subscribe to the MetadataResponse event by calling the `Subscribe()` function.

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp C#
  liveClient.Subscribe(new EventHandler<MetadataResponse>((sender, e) =>
  {
  	Console.WriteLine($"----> MetadataResponse received");
  }));
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### SpeechStartedResponse Event

Subscribe to the SpeechStartedResponse event by calling the `Subscribe()` function.

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp C#
  liveClient.Subscribe(new EventHandler<SpeechStartedResponse>((sender, e) =>
  {
  	Console.WriteLine($"----> SpeechStartedResponse received");
  }));
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### UtteranceEndResponse Event

Subscribe to the UtteranceEndResponse event by calling the `Subscribe()` function.

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp C#
  liveClient.Subscribe(new EventHandler<UtteranceEndResponse>((sender, e) =>
  {
  	Console.WriteLine($"----> UtteranceEndResponse received");
  }));
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### CloseResponse Event

Subscribe to the CloseResponse event by calling the `Subscribe()` function.

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp C#
  liveClient.Subscribe(new EventHandler<CloseResponse>((sender, e) =>
  {
  	Console.WriteLine($"----> CloseResponse received");
  }));
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### ErrorResponse Event

Subscribe to the ErrorResponse event by calling the `Subscribe()` function.

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp C#
  liveClient.Subscribe(new EventHandler<ErrorResponse>((sender, e) =>
  {
  	Console.WriteLine($"----> ErrorResponse received");
  }));
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### UnhandledResponse Event

Subscribe to the UnhandledResponse event by calling the `Subscribe()` function.

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp C#
  liveClient.Subscribe(new EventHandler<UnhandledResponse>((sender, e) =>
  {
  	Console.WriteLine($"----> UnhandledResponse received");
  }));
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Functions

These functions provide capabilities that make up the LiveClient API.

### Sending Data

The `Send` method sends raw audio data to the Deepgram API.

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp C#
  liveClient.Send(AUDIO_STREAM_DATA);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Get Websocket State

The `State` method returns the ready state of the websocket connection to Deepgram.

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp C#
  var websocketState = liveClient.State();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Stop Transcribing

The `Stop` method sends a signal to the Deepgram API that you have finished streaming audio, and it should conclude its transcription efforts. Upon sending the final transcript back, it will close the websocket connection.

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp C#
  await liveClient.Stop()
  ```
</CodeGroup>
