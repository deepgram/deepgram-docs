Deepgram’s Utterances feature allows the chosen model to interact more naturally and effectively with speakers' spontaneous speech patterns. For example, when humans speak to each other conversationally, they often pause mid-sentence to reformulate their thoughts, or stop and restart a badly-worded sentence.

## Enable Feature

To enable utterances, use the following parameter in the query string when you call Deepgram’s `/listen` endpoint :

`utterances=true`

To transcribe audio from a file on your computer, run the following curl command in a terminal or your favorite API client.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl \
    --request POST \
    --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
    --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \
    --data-binary @youraudio.wav \
    --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?utterances=true'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your [Deepgram API Key](/docs/create-additional-api-keys).
</Warning>

## Analyze Response

When the file is finished processing, you’ll receive a JSON response. Let’s look more closely at the `utterances` object:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  ...
  "utterances":[
    {
      "start":0.41915998,
      "end":5.43012,
      "confidence":0.88172823,
      "channel":0,
      "transcript":"four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation",
      "words":[
        {"word":"four","start":0.41915998,"end":0.85827994,"confidence":0.57893836},
   			...
      ],
      "id":"2d8211a4-3a5b-4053-8939-edf2b2b389fa"
    },
    ...
    }
  ]
  ...
  ```
</CodeGroup>

In this response, we see that each utterance contains:

* `start`: Start time (in seconds) from the beginning of the audio stream.
* `end`: End time (in seconds) from the beginning of the audio stream.
* `confidence`: Floating point value between 0 and 1 that indicates overall transcript reliability. Larger values indicate higher confidence.
* `channel`: Audio channel to which the utterance belongs. When using multichannel audio, utterances are chronologically ordered by channel.
* `transcript`: Transcript for the audio segment being processed.
* `words`: Object containing each word in the transcript, along with its start time and end time (in seconds) from the beginning of the audio stream, and a confidence value.

## Advanced Processing

You may also want to enable speaker diarization, which will detect and identify speakers for utterances, and punctuation.

To transcribe audio from a file on your computer, run the following curl command in a terminal or your favorite API client.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl \
    --request POST \
    --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
    --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \
    --data-binary @gettysburg.wav \
    --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?utterances=true&diarize=true&punctuate=true'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your [Deepgram API Key](/docs/create-additional-api-keys).
</Warning>

When the file is finished processing, you’ll receive a JSON response that has the same basic structure as before. Let’s take a closer look at the new `utterances` object:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  ...
  "utterances":[
    {
      "start":0.41874,
      "end":5.42518,
      "confidence":0.88211584,
      "channel":0,
      "transcript":"four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation",
      "words":[
        {"word":"four","start":0.41874,"end":0.85742,"confidence":0.5821198,"speaker":0,"punctuated_word":"four"},
        ...
      ],
      "speaker":0,
      "id":"ec11ce4b-2d5c-4b95-9183-ba102bea1d62"
    },
  ...
  ]
  ...
  ```
</CodeGroup>

In this response, notice that the content of `transcript` in each utterance is now punctuated, and each `word` object in the `words` array contains two new parameters:

* `speaker`: Integer indicating the speaker who is saying the word being processed.
* `punctuated_word`: Word being processed with added punctuation, if any.

To improve readability, you can use a JSON processor to parse the JSON. In this example, we use [JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
  --header "Content-Type: audio/wav" \
  --data-binary @gettysburg.wav \
  --url "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?utterances=true&diarize=true&punctuate=true" | jq -r '.results.utterances[] | "[Speaker:\(.speaker)] \(.transcript)"'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your [Deepgram API Key](/docs/create-additional-api-keys).
</Warning>

When the file is finished processing, you’ll receive the following response:

```
[Speaker:0] four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation
[Speaker:0] conceived liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
[Speaker:0] Now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure.


```
