Deploying Deepgram on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) requires some preparation. In this section, you will learn how to provision a Virtual Machine where you will deploy Deepgram products. You will need to perform some of these steps in the Oracle Cloud Console and some in your local terminal.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have completed the requirements in the [Self-Hosted Introduction](/docs/self-hosted-introduction#prerequisites).

## Accessing Your Cloud Environment

### Create an OCI Compute Instance

​To begin your self-hosted installation with OCI as your cloud service provider, you need to create an OCI instance.

1. In the OCI Console, navigate to the **Compute** section. Select the [compartment](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/foundation/cloud_architecture/governance/compartments.html#understanding-policies) you want to deploy with. Click **Instances**, and then **Create instance**.

   1. Oracle recommends creating resources in compartments other than the `root` compartment on your IAM tenancy. If needed, see [Oracle's documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/compartments/To_create_a_compartment.htm) for details on how to create a new compartment.

2. For the **Name** wizard step, type `Deepgram Self-Hosted`, or another appropriate description of this deployment.

3. For the **Create in compartment** wizard step, select which compartment you want to deploy this instance to.

4. For the **Placement** wizard step, the default options are generally appropriate. You may edit the options, including advanced options, according to your needs.

5. For the **Security** wizard step, edit the options according to your needs.

6. For the **Image and shape** wizard step, click **Edit** to choose a basic configuration to serve as a template for your instance:

   1. Shape

      1. Click **Change shape** to modify the underlying hardware for your instance.

      2. Select the `Virtual machine` instance type.

      3. Select the `Speciality and previous generation` shape series to view shapes with GPUs available.

      4. Search and select `VM.GPU.A10.1`, or another GPU instance type that meets our [minimum required hardware specifications](/docs/configure-your-private-cloud-environment#hardware-specifications).

         1. If none of the shapes shown have an attached GPU, you may need to upgrade your access. The `Browse all shapes` window has a banner on the top offering you the option to upgrade. Follow the instructions to enroll in a plan or request a sales call to gain access to GPU compute.

   2. Image

      1. Pick an image from our list of [recommended Linux distributions](/docs/configure-your-private-cloud-environment#operating-system).
      2. Click **Change Image**, then search for and select your desired image.
         <Info>
           Some images on OCI, such as Oracle Linux 8, have NVIDIA drivers built in. In the selected imaged drop-down, choose an `Image Build` that contains `GPU` in the name.

           If you choose an image with NVIDIA drivers built in, you can skip the `Install NVIDIA Drivers` step in [Drivers and Containerization Platforms](/docs/drivers-and-containerization-platforms#install-nvidia-drivers).
         </Info>

7. For the **Primary VNIC information** wizard step, edit the options according to your needs.

   1. Under **Primary VNIC IP addresses** ensure that `Automatically assign public IPv4 address` is enabled. This will allow you to remotely login to your server.

   <Info>
     If you want to be able to receive requests from the public internet, make sure to configure your Oracle subnet and internet gateway appropriately.

     See Oracle's documentation on [creating a VCN](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/create_vcn.htm), [creating a subnet](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/create_subnet.htm) , and [creating an internet gateway](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/create-ig.htm) for more details.
   </Info>

8. For the **Add SSH keys** wizard step, decide whether to generate a new key pair or use an existing SSH key. If you have Oracle generate a new key pair for you, download the `.key` file and take note of the location.

9. For the **Boot volume** wizard step, change the boot volume size if necessary to meet our [minimum required hardware specifications](/docs/configure-your-private-cloud-environment#hardware-specifications) . Edit the other available options according to your needs.

   <Warning>
     If you increase the Boot volume size on instance creation or by editing a running instance, make sure to expand the root partition of the instance to use this additional allocated storage. See the [Oracle documentation on `oci-growfs`](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/oracle-linux/oci-utils/index.htm#oci-growfs) for guidance on how to do this.
   </Warning>

10. For the **Block volume** wizard step, attach block volumes according to your needs.

11. Verify that the wizard contains all the right details for your desired instance. Click `Create` to create your compute instance.

12. If you would like to save these options for future usage, click `Save stack` instead and follow the steps presented. Make sure to check `Run apply` during the review step to create an instance.

13. The job details for the instance creation will be displayed. The Terraform plan and logs will show, and once completed, the instance creation job will be marked as `Succeeded`.

### Log in to the OCI Compute Instance

To complete the rest of the installation, including configuring your environment and transferring files between your local computer and your OCI instance, you must connect to the instance that you launched.

1. You need to find the instance's Public IPv4 DNS entry. In the OCI Console, navigate back to the `Compute -> Instances` page.

2. Find the newly provisioned compute instance. Take note of the Public IP assigned to this instance. This will be the `IP_ADDR` value that is referenced later.

3. Open the terminal application for your computer.

4. Connect to your OCI instance:

   <CodeGroup>
     ```shell Shell
     ssh -i /path/to/private-key.key USERNAME@IP_ADDR
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   <Info>
     Be sure to replace the `IP_ADDR` and `USERNAME` placeholder values. The `IP_ADDR` is the public IP for your instance. If you used an Oracle Linux or CentOS platform image, the `USERNAME` is `opc`. If you used an Ubuntu platform image to create the instance, the username is `ubuntu`.

     Also check that the path to your `private-key.key` file is correct.
   </Info>

   <Info>
     If you are on a Windows machine, PuTTY is an alternative to `ssh`.
   </Info>

5. If you receive a message that indicates that the authenticity of the host can’t be established, type `yes`, then press the `Enter` key on your keyboard. This message should only appear the first time you are connected to the instance.

What’s Next

Now that we have provisioned a deployment environment, we need to start configuring it for inference.
