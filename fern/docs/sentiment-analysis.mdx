Deepgram's Sentiment Analysis feature recognizes the sentiment of the entire transcript and detects shifts in sentiment throughout the transcript.

A `sentiment` of `positive`, `negative`, or `neutral` along with a `sentiment_score` is identified for each segment of the transcript, and an `average` of the entire transcript's sentiment is also provided along with the average `sentiment_score`.

This sentiment feature produces sentiment analysis at every level of transcription requested, so you'll get sentiment values for every word, sentence, utterance, and paragraph, in addition to the top-level sentiment for the entire transcription.

<Info>
  The break point for a `sentiment_score` becoming positive or negative is `+-0.333333333...`.

The `sentiment` values added to objects are:

* `sentiment`: The sentiment of the associated text ('positive' | 'negative' | 'neutral').
* `sentiment_score`: A floating point value between -1 and 1 representing the sentiment of the associated span of text. -1 being the most negative sentiment, and 1 being the most positive sentiment.
