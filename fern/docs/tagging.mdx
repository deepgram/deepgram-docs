Deepgram’s Tagging feature allows you to label your API requests for the purpose of identification during usage reporting. You can also apply tags to API Keys; if you do, any tags applied to the API Key running the API request will also be applied to the request itself.

Tags are limited to 128 characters per tag.

## Enable Feature

To enable Tagging, when you call Deepgram’s API, add a `tag` parameter in the query string and set it to the tag you would like to recognize:

`tag=VALUE`

To transcribe audio from a file on your computer, run the following cURL command in a terminal or your favorite API client. Please be aware that once you have set a tag, you cannot modify it.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl \
    --request POST \
    --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
    --data-binary @youraudio.wav \
    --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?tag=VALUE'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your [Deepgram API Key](/docs/create-additional-api-keys).
</Warning>

## Filter Requests by Tag

Once applied, you can identify tags associated with API requests returned by the [Get All Requests](/reference/get-all-requests), [Get Request](/reference/get-request), and [Get Fields](/reference/get-fields) endpoints.

You can also directly query requests by tag at the [Summarize Usage](/reference/summarize-usage) endpoint.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl \
    --request GET \
    --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
    --header 'content-type: application/json'
    --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/usage?tag=VALUE'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Replace the placeholder `PROJECT_ID` with your Deepgram Console Project ID, `VALUE` with your tag, and `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your Deepgram API Key.
</Warning>

## Special Considerations

### White Space or Special Characters

If your tag or extra metadata includes spaces or special characters, be sure to URL encode it:

`tag=marketing%20team` or `tag=marketing+team`

### Apply Multiple Instances

To apply multiple tags or multiple extra key-value pairs, submit the query parameter multiple times in your API request:

`tag=marketing&tag=legal`

## Comparison to Extra Metadata

[Extra Metadata](/docs/extra-metadata) is a similar feature to Tagging. Where Tagging is primarily intended for tracking and filtering usage, Extra Metadata is useful for passing data to downstream processing steps.

Below is a comparison table summarizing the main differences between the two features:

|                                                           | Tagging   | Extra Metadata |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| Primarily for passing data to downstream processing steps | ❌         | ✅              |
| Primarily for tracking usage                              | ✅         | ❌              |
| Configurable per request                                  | ✅         | ✅              |
| Configurable per API key                                  | ✅         | ❌              |
| Character limit per value                                 | 128 chars | 2048 chars     |

| Can specify a key in a key-value pair                     | ❌         | ✅              |
| Can specify a value in a key-value pair                   | ✅         | ✅              |
