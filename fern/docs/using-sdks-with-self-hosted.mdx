By default, Deepgram's SDKs hit the hosted endpoint `api.deepgram.com`. To use one of our SDKs with your self-hosted deployment, you will need to specify your own self-hosted endpoint instead.

## Determining your host URL

If running your requests locally on your server, your URL may be as simple as `http://localhost:8080` (pre-recorded) or `ws://localhost:8080` (streaming).

If running your requests on other servers, you may be using a static IP, such as `http://172.23.0.1:8080`.

If you use a multi-server or auto-scaled environment, you may configure a URL that is served by a load balancer that routes your requests across several instances.

Note that for a host that does not have TLS enabled, you will use `http` rather than `https`, and `ws` rather than `wss`.

## Python SDK

When deploying in a containerized environment, you can set client configuration parameters using the class `ClientOptionsFromEnv`. This will set configuration options in `DeepgramClientOptions`, obtaining those inputs from environments variables. Set the `DEEPGRAM_HOST` environment variable to direct your requests to your self-hosted rather than the hosted API.

Alternatively, you may also pass the `url` parameter as input in code to the `DeepgramClientOptions` constructor.

Below is an example of how to make your first API request to your self-hosted deployment using the Python SDK. Substitute your own host address in place of `localhost` if needed.

Note that the `api_key` field cannot be a blank string as it is a required parameter for the Python SDK, but it does not need to be a valid Deepgram API key, as authorization with Deepgram for self-hosted deployments is configured through the container, not at the individual request level.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from deepgram import DeepgramClient, ClientOptionsFromEnv, PrerecordedOptions

  deepgram = DeepgramClient(config=ClientOptionsFromEnv(api_key="a", url="http://localhost:8080"))
  response = deepgram.listen.prerecorded.v("1").transcribe_url(
    {
      "url": "https://static.deepgram.com/examples/Bueller-Life-moves-pretty-fast.wav"
    },
    PrerecordedOptions(
      model="nova-3",
      smart_format=True
    ),
  )
  print(response)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## .NET SDK

The .NET SDK provides `DeepgramHttpClientOptions `(pre-recorded) and `DeepgramWsClientOptions` (streaming) classes, through which you can pass your host address. Below is a streaming example. Note that you should provide the `/v1` suffix to the base address.

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp C#
  var apiKey = "<your API key>";
  var options = new DeepgramWsClientOptions(){
    BaseAddress = "ws://localhost:8080/v1"
  };
  var liveClient = new LiveClient(apiKey, options);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

If you encounter the following error message, note that you are receiving a 400 (bad request) when a 101 (successful stream) is expected.

<CodeGroup>
  ```text Text
  Error: "The server returned status code \u0027400\u0027 when status code \u0027101\u0027 was expected."
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Ensure that your request parameters are specifying a model that you have available on your self-hosted instance. For example, when you intend to serve requests through a Nova-3 model, specify the following params:

<CodeGroup>
  ```csharp C#
  var liveSchema = new LiveSchema()
  {
    Model = "nova-3",
    SmartFormat = true,
  };
  ```
</CodeGroup>

If that model is not present in your `models/` directory, the above error will occur.

## Go SDK

To modify the `Host` option in [type-client.go](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/v1.3.6/pkg/client/interfaces/types-client.go):

<CodeGroup>
  ```go Go
  // ClientOptions defines any options for the client
  type ClientOptions struct {
  	...
  	Host       string // override for the host endpoint
  	...
  	SelfHosted bool   // set to true if using self-hosted
    ...
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You can create an object of type `ClientOptions` and then set the `Host` value.

<CodeGroup>
  ```go Go
  	// create a Deepgram client
  	c := client.New("", interfaces.ClientOptions{
  		Host: "http://localhost:8080",
      SelfHosted: true,
  	})
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## JavaScript SDK

To modify the URL, you can pass the `url` property within the global object to a new client.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript JavaScript
  const options: DeepgramClientOptions = {
    global: {
      url: "http://localhost:8080", // Set the desired URL here
    }
  };

  const client = createClient("DEEPGRAM_API_KEY", options);
  ```
</CodeGroup>
