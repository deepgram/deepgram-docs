The `AgentAudioDone` Message will communicate the last audio message has been sent from the server.

## Purpose

The `AgentAudioDone` message signals that the server has finished sending the final audio segment to the client. This message provides a clear endpoint for audio streaming, helping clients manage playback timing and synchronize further actions accordingly.

## Example Payload

The server will send an `AgentAudioDone` message immediately after it sends the last audio message. In some cases even though no more audio messages are being received, the agent may still be speaking, because previously sent audio may still be queued for playback.
