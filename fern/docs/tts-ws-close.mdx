To close the websocket connection, you can either send an websocket `Close` frame, or send the optional `close` message.

# What is the `Close` Message?

In real-time text-to-speech processing, there are scenarios where you may need to force the server to end the connection (or close) immediately. Deepgram supports a `Close` message to handle such situations.

## Sending `Close`

To send the `Close` message, you need to send the following JSON message to the server:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
      "type": "Close"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## `Close` Confirmation

Upon receiving the `Close` message, the server will close the websocket connect and return:

```
Disconnected from wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/speak  
14:57:21  

1000 Normal Closure:

Connection was closed successfully.
```

# Conclusion

In real-time text-to-speech processing, situations may arise where you need to immediately stop the server's operations. To manage this, Deepgram provides a `Close` message, which ensures the server halts processing and closes the connection promptly, maintaining control and responsiveness in critical scenarios.
