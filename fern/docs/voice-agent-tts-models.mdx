By default [Deepgram Text-to-Speech](/docs/tts-models) will be used with the Voice Agent API, but if you opt to use another provider's TTS model with your Agent, you can do so by applying the following settings.

## Deepgram TTS models

These are just some of our most popular TTS voices. For a complete list see the [TTS Models Documentation](/docs/tts-models) .

| agent.speak.model | Gender |
| ----------------- | ------ |
| `aura-stella-en`  | Female |
| `aura-asteria-en` | Female |
| `aura-luna-en`    | Female |
| `aura-arcas-en`   | Male   |

## Example

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
    "speak": {
      "model": "aura-asteria-en"
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  You can set your Text-to-Speech model in the [Setting Configuration](/docs/voice-agent-settings-configuration) for your Voice Agent. See the docs for more information.

## Third Party TTS models

To use a third party TTS voice, specify the TTS provider and one of their available voice IDs.

For ElevenLabs you can refer to [this article](https://help.elevenlabs.io/hc/en-us/articles/14599760033937-How-do-I-find-my-voices-ID-of-my-voices-via-the-website-and-through-the-API) on how to find your Voice ID or [use their API](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/voices/get-all) to retrieve it. We support any of ElevenLabs' Turbo 2.5 voices to ensure low latency interactions.

For Cartesia you can [use their API](https://docs.cartesia.ai/api-reference/voices/list) to retrieve a voice ID.

| agent.speak.provider | speak.voice\_id   |
| -------------------- | ----------------- |
| `eleven_labs`        | `unique_voice_id` |
| `cartesia`           | `unique_voice_id` |

## Example

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
    "speak": {
      "provider": "eleven_labs",
      "voice_id": "bIHbv24MWmeRgasZH58o"
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>
