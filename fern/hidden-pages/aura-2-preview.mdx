## Aura-2: our most natural text-to-speech model for realtime conversations

Aura-2 is our most natural text-to-speech model for conversational AI and real-time experiences with a low time-to-first-byte latency of \<150ms\. Aura-2 is well-suited for customers looking for:

1. Real-time conversational experiences with 150ms latency
2. Natural, engaging conversational voice. Someone you'd actually want to talk to.
3. Affordable, high-throughput enterprise scaling (available soon)
4. Self-hosted deployment for reduced latency, enhanced security, and flexible concurrency scaling (available soon)
5. Robust pronunciation across specialized domains like medical and finance
6. Voices that just work - natural pauses with phone numbers, appropriate empathy in various contexts.

Common use cases our customers are building for include customer service agents,  outbound sales, healthcare, finance, food ordering, workplace productivity, and interactive media. We are starting with English and will expand to other languages soon. If you have a particular language or accent you're looking for, please let your Deepgram contact know or [fill out this form](https://deepgram.typeform.com/aura-languages).

## Limits

This is an early access endpoint. To ensure availability and fair use:

- Do not use this endpoint in production.
- Please limit your requests to 5-10 concurrent requests.

### Text Input Limit

This early access endpoint only supports text input with \<1000 characters (~1 min 15s of audio output). If your text input is larger than our limit, the audio output will be cut off in the end.

## CURL

You can call the endpoint at:

`https://aura-2-ea.api.deepgram.com/v1/speak?model=aura-2-andromeda-en`

Try it with CURL. Add your own API key where it says `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` and then run the following example in a terminal or your favorite API client.

```Text cURL
curl --request POST \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --header "Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY" \
  --output your_output_file.wav \
  --data '{"text":"Hello, how can I help you today?"}' \
  --url "https://aura-2-ea.api.deepgram.com/v1/speak?model=aura-2-andromeda-en&container=wav"
```

To get your `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`You can use your usual DG API token for authentication. Go to [https://console.deepgram.com](https://console.deepgram.com/), sign in, and create an API key.
