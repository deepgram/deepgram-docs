Explore some common issues faced by Hotpepper users and administrators, and learn how to resolve them.

## The Get ASR button doesn't show

Make sure the level you are transcribing at is L1. Only assigned files at level L1 can be transcribed automatically using ASR.

Check that Hotpepper is properly configured to allow Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). To learn more about configuring ASR for automatic transcription, visit [Hotpepper User Guide: Setting Up](/on-prem/optional-components/hotpepper/setting-up/).

## I can’t find a file that I worked on

Hotpepper’s design is informed by Deepgram best practices, which require that each audio file is reviewed by four independent users. Once you have submitted a file as completed at one level, you will no longer be able to edit it at any other level.

## I added a dataset, but it wasn’t created

Before a new dataset can be added to the Hotpepper database, the audio files must be collected and placed in a subdirectory on the underlying file system. Once the audio files are in place, the dataset can be added to the database through Hotpepper. To learn more about adding datasets, visit [Hotpepper User Guide: Adding Datasets](/on-prem/optional-components/hotpepper/managing-datasets/#adding-datasets).

## I can’t get the application to start

Check that you have set values for `db`, `datasets`, and `packaged_datasets_location` in Hotpepper's configuration file (`config.toml`). These are required settings, and the application will not start without them. To see a sample configuration file for Hotpepper, visit [Hotpepper User Guide: Setting Up](/on-prem/optional-components/hotpepper/setting-up/).

## The application can’t find my files at the configured file paths

When you configure Hotpepper using the `config.toml` file, keep in mind that the configured settings should match what are mapped in the Docker Compose file when deploying Deepgram products. These are not file paths on your actual underlying file system; rather, they are file paths in the Docker container’s file system.

Let’s look at a comparison between Hotpepper’s `config.toml` file and the Docker Compose deployment file:

**Hotpepper configuration file**

```toml
# The container path to the Hotpepper database. (Note: Naming conventions may
# mention Dashscript, a previous version of Hotpepper; they are the same tool.)
db = "/db/dashscript.db"
```

**Docker Compose deployment file**

```yaml
# Path to the Hotpepper database directory.  The name of the database will be
# pulled from the Hotpepper config file.
- "/path/to/database:/db"
```

Notice that the setting in the Docker Compose file is separated into two parts by a colon (`:`). The left side of the setting contains the path on your underlying file system, while the right side contains the Docker container path to which it should be mapped. The Hotpepper `config.toml` file directory (`/db`) should match the value on the right side of the Docker Compose setting (`/db`).
